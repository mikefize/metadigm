# Virus: The Essex Chav



### The Patch

# Chapter 1: The Patch

Vesper Irons pressed her thumb against the bridge of her reading glasses, massaging away the phantom ache that lived there permanently now. Fluorescent lights hummed overhead in Room 214, casting everything in that particular shade of institutional beige that made her think of old bandages.

"Miss Irons?" The girl's voice pulled her back. Madison Carver, eleven years old, picking at the edge of her binder with bitten nails.

"Yes, sorry." Vesper straightened, refocusing on the essay before her. The margins bled with her red ink—gentle corrections, encouraging notes. *Good metaphor here!* and *Love your thinking!* She'd spent forty minutes on this one paper alone. "Your analysis of 'The Outsiders' shows real depth, Madison. The way you connected Ponyboy's alienation to modern social media isolation? That's college-level thinking."

Madison's face lit up. That glow—that moment when a student *understood*—used to be enough. Should still be enough.

Vesper's phone buzzed. She ignored it. Probably her mother again, with another concerned text about her "hermit lifestyle." As if teaching middle school left energy for anything else.

The parent-teacher conference schedule mocked her from the wall: fourteen appointments in four hours, starting in twenty minutes. She smoothed her navy cardigan, checked her reflection in the darkened window. Mousy brown hair in its perpetual low bun. No makeup—what was the point? The purple shadows under her eyes existed beyond concealer's reach anyway.

Her doctorate thesis sat in a milk crate under her desk. *Post-Colonial Feminist Narratives in Contemporary Young Adult Literature*. Three hundred and forty-seven pages that had died the moment her advisor retired and the funding evaporated. Dr. Vesper Irons, professor of literature. That ghost still haunted her at 3 AM, when the wine wore off and her studio apartment pressed in too close.

"Miss Irons?" Madison again. "Are you okay? You look tired."

*You look tired.* From the mouths of eleven-year-olds.

"Just a long week, sweetie. Now, about revising your conclusion—"

The evening conferences blurred together. Concerned mothers and distracted fathers, everyone's child either gifted or misunderstood, never simply average. Vesper nodded, smiled, reassured. Her jaw ached from maintaining the expression.

Then came Marcus Carver at 7:15 PM, last appointment of the night.

He wasn't what she expected. Madison's file said "single father," but Vesper had pictured someone older, rumpled. Marcus Carver moved like liquid confidence in expensive casual—dark jeans, slate button-down, watch that probably cost more than her monthly rent. Pharmaceutical sales, she remembered from the intake forms.

"Ms. Irons." His handshake lasted a fraction too long, warm and dry. "Marcus. Madison can't stop talking about your class."

They discussed his daughter's work, her progress, her sensitivity. He listened with full attention, not checking his phone once—a rarity. When Vesper mentioned Madison's essay, he leaned forward, and she caught his cologne. Something with cedar and leather that made her aware of how long it had been since she'd sat this close to an adult man.

"You look exhausted," he said finally, voice dropping to something almost intimate. "Madison mentioned you're here until six or seven most nights."

"Teacher hours." She shrugged, defensive. "Grading doesn't do itself."

"No, but you need to take care of yourself too." He reached into his messenger bag. "I know this is unorthodox, but I work for Helix BioSolutions. We've been beta-testing a wellness patch—transdermal vitamin delivery system. B-complex, adaptogens, some proprietary compounds for stress management. Clinical trials have been remarkable."

He placed a small black box on her desk. Matte finish, silver lettering.

Vesper stared at it. "I can't accept—"

"It's not a bribe." His smile crinkled his eyes. "Madison's brilliant because you're brilliant. I'm just a father who sees someone burning herself out for kids who aren't even hers." He stood, buttoning his jacket. "Think of it as... teacher appreciation. God knows the district doesn't do enough of that."

After he left, Vesper sat in the empty classroom's silence. Outside, streetlights flickered on. Inside, the black box seemed to pulse with promise.

She opened it.

The patch lay nestled in medical-grade foam, about the size of a silver dollar. Translucent, barely visible. The instruction card was minimal: *Apply to clean, dry skin. Replace every 72 hours. Optimal results 4-6 weeks.*

Vesper turned it over in her fingers. The rational part of her brain—the part that had written a dissertation, that fact-checked student research—screamed caution. Unlabeled medication from a parent? Insane.

But another part, the part that woke gasping at 2 AM from dreams of the life she'd meant to have, that poured second and third glasses of wine just to quiet the screaming disappointment—that part whispered *why not?*

What was she protecting anyway? This half-life of grading papers in an empty apartment, watching former classmates post tenure announcements on Facebook, spending Friday nights alphabetizing her classroom library?

In the teacher's bathroom, she peeled off the backing. The patch's adhesive felt cool against her lower abdomen, just below her navel. She pressed it smooth, waiting for something.

Nothing happened.

Vesper studied her reflection. Same tired eyes. Same mousy hair escaping its bun. Same woman disappearing by degrees into beige anonymity.

She locked up Room 214, drove home to her studio, microwaved leftover pasta. The patch stayed forgotten under her clothes, barely there.

When she finally slept, her dreams tasted like copper and honey, and somewhere deep in her cells, something new began to wake.

### Chapter 2 - The Threshold

# Chapter 2: The Threshold

The morning arrived wrong.

Vesper woke before her alarm, body thrumming with unfamiliar energy. Not coffee-jitters or anxiety—something smoother, warmer. Like her blood had been replaced with something more efficient. She lay in the tangle of sheets, watching dawn paint her ceiling gold, and for the first time in years didn't immediately catalog her inadequacies.

The shower water felt different against her skin. More *present*. Each droplet registered as a tiny explosion of sensation. She found herself turning the temperature hotter than usual, steam billowing until the mirror disappeared completely. When she emerged, pink-skinned and tingling, she caught herself mid-reach for the usual cardigan and paused.

In the back of her closet, shoved behind sensible khakis and oxford shirts, hung the black wrap dress she'd bought for a conference two years ago. Never worn. Too young for her, she'd decided. Too attention-seeking. The tag still dangled from the armpit.

Vesper pulled it on. The fabric clung differently than her usual armor—it *acknowledged* she had a body underneath. The V-neck dipped lower than anything else she owned. She stared at her reflection, waiting for the familiar shame spiral.

It didn't come.

Instead, something sparked in her chest. Something that whispered *yes*.

She left her hair down, loose waves brushing her shoulders. Applied mascara for the first time in months, then—impulsively—lipstick. Dusty rose that she'd bought on a whim and never touched. In the mirror, a stranger looked back. Not beautiful, not yet, but *awake*.

The patch pressed against her lower abdomen like a secret heartbeat.

Traffic moved too slowly. Vesper found herself drumming on the steering wheel, impatient in a way that felt both foreign and delicious. At a red light, construction workers wolf-whistled from a site. The old Vesper would have hunched down, humiliated. This morning, something in her chest expanded. Preened.

*They see me.*

She arrived at school twenty minutes early—unheard of. The halls stretched empty and echoing, lockers gleaming dully under fluorescent lights. Usually, Vesper scurried straight to her classroom, head down, invisible. Today she walked differently. Slower. Aware of how the dress moved with her hips, how her heels clicked against linoleum.

"Well, well." Derek Simmons leaned against the mailroom doorframe, coffee steaming in his ridiculous *World's Okayest Teacher* mug. Math department, divorced three times, perpetually five minutes from a sexual harassment seminar. "Someone got a makeover. Hot date last night, Vesper?"

The old response would have been stammered denial, maybe a self-deprecating joke about her nonexistent social life. Instead, Vesper met his eyes and smiled. Not a friendly smile. Something with teeth.

"Wouldn't you like to know."

She walked past him, feeling his stare like heat against her back. Good. Let him look. Let them all look.

Room 214 felt smaller than yesterday, stuffier. Vesper opened windows despite the autumn chill, craving air movement against her skin. Her first class wouldn't arrive for thirty minutes. She should be setting up worksheets, writing objectives on the board. Instead, she stood at the window, watching the parking lot fill with buses and sedans.

The patch pulsed against her stomach. Or maybe that was just her heartbeat. Hard to tell anymore.

Her phone buzzed. Marcus Carver.

*Just checking in. Any initial thoughts on the patch?*

Vesper stared at the message. Professional boundaries screamed she shouldn't respond. He was a parent. This crossed lines. But her fingers moved anyway.

*Slept better than I have in years. Feeling... different. Good different.*

The reply came within seconds.

*Excellent. That's the B-complex kicking in. You might notice increased energy, elevated mood. All normal. Maybe we could discuss your experience over coffee? Purely research purposes—we need user feedback for the next trial phase.*

Her thumb hovered over the screen. Coffee with a parent. Absolutely inappropriate. Principal Harper would have a stroke.

*When?*

*Saturday? There's a café in Roxbury. The Grinding Stone. 10 AM?*

Roxbury. Thirty minutes away. Far enough that no one from school would see them.

*It's a date.*

She sent it before she could reconsider, then stared at the words glowing accusingly. *It's a date.* Jesus. What was she thinking?

But the panic she expected never arrived. Instead, that warm expansion in her chest again. Anticipation mixed with something darker, hungrier.

The first bell shattered her reverie. Students flooded the halls—that particular middle school chaos of slamming lockers and shrieking voices. Vesper's first period filed in: thirty-two seventh graders, only half of whom had done last night's reading.

"Whoa, Miss Irons!" Tyler Chen stopped mid-stride. "You look like... different."

"Yeah," Madison Carver added, sliding into her usual front-row seat. Her eyes narrowed slightly, assessing. "Really different."

Other students murmured agreement. Vesper felt their attention like spotlight heat. Usually, she deflected compliments, made herself smaller. Today, she crossed to her desk and perched on the edge instead of standing behind it, letting the dress ride up slightly.

"Thank you, Tyler. Now, who can tell me about the symbolism in chapter four?"

The lesson flowed better than usual. Students engaged more, hands shooting up. Even the chronic non-participants contributed. Vesper moved around the room instead of lecturing from the front, aware of eyes following her. Male students who'd never noticed her before suddenly volunteered to pass out papers, to help carry books.

She should have felt uncomfortable. Instead, she felt *powerful*.

During lunch, she sat in the teacher's lounge—another break from routine. Usually, she ate in her classroom, alone with grading. Today, she wanted company. Witnesses.

The conversations shifted when she entered. Carol from English lit glanced at Jasmine from history, some unspoken communication passing between them. By the coffee maker, Principal Harper did a double-take.

"Vesper. New look?"

"Just trying something different." She poured coffee, black, though she usually drowned it in cream. The bitter hit her tongue like a kiss.

"Well." Harper's smile didn't reach her eyes. "It's certainly... noticeable."

Vesper claimed the good chair by the window and pulled out her phone. Scrolled Instagram—something she never did at work. Found herself lingering on posts from college friends. Their perfect lives, perfect bodies. Vacation photos from Greece and Bali. Designer clothes and wine bars.

The familiar envy rose, but different now. Not defeated, not resigned. Instead, it felt like gasoline on a spark.

*I could have that. I could be that.*

Outside, behind the maintenance shed where students thought no one could see, two seniors shared a cigarette. Vesper watched through the window—the way the girl tilted her head back to exhale, how the boy watched her do it. Smoke curled into October air like something alive.

Vesper had never smoked. Never even been tempted. Her mother's warnings about cancer and wrinkles had taken root deep. But watching that girl, the casual rebellion of it, the way she looked so *alive*—

The bell rang. Time to teach again. Vesper stood, smoothing her dress, and caught her reflection in the microwave's glass door.

Her eyes looked different. Brighter. Almost feverish.

The patch hummed against her skin, and somewhere deep in her rewritten cells, LUMEN-7 continued its work, patient and thorough, transforming her one neuron at a time.

### The First Mark

# Chapter 3: The First Mark

The tanning salon squatted between a nail bar and a vape shop in a strip mall Vesper had driven past a thousand times without seeing. Wednesday afternoon, and she'd called in sick for the first time in three years. Her voice had sounded convincingly raspy on Principal Harper's voicemail—throaty and raw in a way that sent an unexpected thrill through her chest.

*Sun Kissed Paradise*. Neon palm trees flickered in the window.

Vesper sat in her car for ten minutes, hands gripping the steering wheel. This was insane. She'd written papers about the dangers of UV exposure, had lectured students about melanoma statistics. Her mother had raised her to fear the sun like an enemy, slathering her in SPF-50 every summer morning.

But since Tuesday, something had been crawling under her skin. An itch that lived too deep for scratching. She'd caught herself staring at photos of bronzed women on Instagram—not with her usual academic disdain for patriarchal beauty standards, but with something closer to hunger. The pale limbs reflected in her bathroom mirror that morning had looked wrong. Unfinished. Like a sketch waiting for color.

The patch pressed warm against her abdomen. Or maybe that heat came from inside her now. Hard to distinguish anymore.

Inside, the salon smelled like coconut oil and ozone. Pop music throbbed from hidden speakers. Behind the counter, a girl with ombré hair and eyelash extensions looked up from her phone. Early twenties, spray-tanned to the color of caramel, wearing a crop top that showed off her pierced navel.

Everything about her screamed the opposite of Vesper's carefully constructed academic respectability. And God, she looked *happy*. Comfortable in her skin in a way Vesper had never been.

"First time?" The girl—her nametag read *Kayleigh*—smiled without judgment.

"That obvious?"

"You've got that look." Kayleigh pulled out a binder, flipped it open to reveal laminated charts. "Don't worry, babe. We'll start you easy. Level one bed, eight minutes max. You're like... what, Fitzpatrick Type II? Maybe Type III?"

Vesper had no idea what that meant but nodded anyway.

"Perfect." Kayleigh's acrylic nails clicked across a keyboard. "So the thing is, you wanna build your base tan gradually, yeah? Your skin needs time to develop melanin. Too much too fast, you'll just burn and peel, and that's rank." She leaned forward conspiratorially. "But between you and me? Once you get that base sorted, you'll be gagging for it. Everyone is. It's like... addictive in the best way."

Something in Vesper's chest tightened. Addictive. The word should have sent her running. Instead, it sounded like a promise.

Kayleigh led her down a hallway lined with doors. Each had a number and a glowing occupancy indicator. Behind them, Vesper heard the hum of bulbs, the whir of cooling fans.

"Here we go. Bed seven." Kayleigh pushed open the door to reveal a room the size of a closet. The tanning bed dominated the space—a sleek white coffin that opened like a clamshell. Inside, rows of purple-blue bulbs waited. "So, strip down to whatever you're comfortable with. Most girls go full nude for even coverage, but it's your call. Goggles are mandatory—your eyes will literally cook otherwise. Timer's set for eight minutes. Just lie down, close the lid, and relax. The bed'll shut off automatic."

She demonstrated the lid mechanism, pointed out the panic button, then left with another flash of her perfect white teeth.

Vesper stood alone in the humming room. Her reflection stared back from a full-length mirror—pale and overdressed in her usual armor of cardigan and khakis. She'd changed after calling in sick, unable to justify wearing the black dress with nowhere to go. Now she wished she'd kept it on. This version of herself looked wrong. Timid.

Her fingers found the patch through her shirt. Just checking it was still there.

She undressed mechanically, folding clothes on a plastic chair. Sports bra and cotton underwear—sensible and sexless. The cool air raised goosebumps across her exposed skin. In the mirror, her body looked foreign. When had she last really *looked* at herself? Pale breasts with pink nipples, soft belly, thighs that touched at the top. Not terrible. Not great. Just... unremarkable.

The goggles made her look like an alien. She climbed into the bed, the acrylic cool against her back, and stared up at the bulbs inches from her face. This close, she could see the filaments inside, delicate as spider silk.

Her hand found the lid. One pull and it would close. Seal her in.

*This is stupid. This is dangerous. This isn't you.*

But who was she, exactly? The woman who'd spent fifteen years becoming invisible? Who'd turned herself into a shadow so efficient that even her own mother forgot to call sometimes?

Vesper pulled the lid down.

The darkness lasted only a second. Then the bulbs ignited with an electric *hum* that she felt in her teeth. Purple-blue light flooded the enclosed space, so bright it turned the inside of her eyelids orange even behind the goggles.

Heat came next. Not the aggressive blast of a furnace, but something more insidious—a gentle pressure that built and built, pressing down on every inch of exposed skin. Vesper held herself rigid, waiting for the burn, for the pain that would justify her fear.

It didn't come.

Instead, the heat seeped deeper, past her skin's surface, into muscle and bone. Her body began to relax by degrees, tension she hadn't known she was carrying melting away. The bed's hum became white noise, almost soothing. Almost hypnotic.

And then—*oh.*

The sensation started small, a warmth in her core that had nothing to do with the bulbs. It spread outward like ink in water, unfurling through her belly, her chest, her limbs. Not sexual exactly, but not *not* sexual either. Somewhere between a full-body massage and the first sip of excellent wine.

Vesper's breath came faster. Her skin tingled, hypersensitive, aware of every millimeter of contact with the acrylic beneath her. The heat pressed down like a lover's weight, firm and insistent, and something in her rose to meet it.

She'd read about tanning addiction in grad school—how UV exposure triggered endorphin release, creating a genuine biochemical dependency. She'd thought it was weakness, vanity disguised as science.

This wasn't weakness. This was *revelation*.

Her back arched slightly, involuntarily. Behind the goggles, her eyes rolled back. The purple light painted the inside of her skull in colors that shouldn't exist, and with each breath, that central warmth pulsed stronger. Her nipples hardened against her sports bra. Between her legs, a different heat began to build.

*This is the melanin production*, she told herself frantically. *Increased blood flow to the skin. Completely normal physiological response.*

But that rationalization felt thin, inadequate. This wasn't just physiology. This was her body waking up after decades of sleep, stretching and purring like something feral.

The timer ticked down somewhere outside her awareness. Vesper floated in purple-black warmth, feeling her cells drink in the radiation, feeling something fundamental shift in the architecture of her flesh. The patch on her abdomen blazed hot—or maybe that was just her imagination.

When the bulbs finally shut off, the sudden darkness felt like abandonment. Vesper gasped, disoriented, her skin still thrumming with phantom heat. She lay there for a long moment, afraid to move, afraid this feeling would evaporate the moment she opened the lid.

Eventually, she climbed out on shaky legs. In the mirror, her skin looked flushed, pink-bright like she'd been slapped all over. Her eyes were huge and glazed, pupils blown wide. She looked drunk. Fucked.

She looked *alive*.

Kayleigh smiled when Vesper emerged. "Good first session?"

"Yeah." Vesper's voice came out husky. "Really good."

"Told you. Most people are proper hooked after the first go." She tapped on her keyboard. "So you'll wanna come back in like, forty-eight hours. Let your skin recover, build that melanin. Then we can bump you up to ten minutes, maybe level two bed."

Vesper nodded, barely hearing. Her skin still sang with aftershocks, and all she could think about was getting back inside that purple warmth, feeling that pressure, that *release*.

"Actually," she heard herself say, "what's your membership pricing?"

Kayleigh's smile widened. "Now you're talking. We do unlimited monthly for £45. You can come every day if you want, though I'd say every other day is optimal for building color without overdoing it."

Every other day. Vesper's calendar flashed before her eyes—parent meetings, faculty obligations, grading. Things that suddenly felt crushingly irrelevant compared to eight minutes of this feeling.

"I'll take it."

She paid with her credit card, the one she barely used, and walked out into the grey October afternoon feeling like she'd left something essential behind in that humming room. The normal world looked muted now, colors dialed down. People moved around her like sleepwalkers.

In her car, Vesper caught her reflection in the rearview mirror. Her cheeks glowed pink. Her eyes glittered with something new—something hungry and unapologetic.

The patch pressed warm against her belly, and deep in her rewriting brain, LUMEN-7 flooded her reward centers with dopamine, etching new neural pathways, teaching her body to crave what it had just tasted.

She started the engine, but instead of heading home, she sat there, fingers drumming on the steering wheel. Saturday's coffee date with Marcus felt too far away. She needed... something. Movement. Stimulation. The thought of her empty studio apartment made her skin crawl.

Her phone buzzed. Marcus Carver, as if summoned by thought alone.

*How are you feeling today? Any interesting developments?*

Vesper stared at the message, then typed back without overthinking.

*Just tried something new. Tanning bed. Is it normal to feel this good?*

His response came fast.

*Perfectly normal. The patch enhances your body's natural reward responses. Makes you more attuned to pleasurable stimuli. Enjoy it. You deserve to feel good.*

*You deserve to feel good.* When was the last time someone had told her that? When was the last time she'd believed it?

Vesper set the phone down and touched her flushed cheek, feeling the heat still radiating from her skin. In the tanning bed's purple light, something inside her had cracked open. And now that the seal was broken, she didn't think she could close it again.

Didn't think she wanted to.

### The Escalation

# Chapter 4: The Escalation

The coffee shop smelled like pretension and burnt arabica. Vesper arrived fifteen minutes early, then circled the block twice because sitting alone in a café felt too vulnerable, too exposed. When she finally entered, the barista—a boy with stretched earlobes and a Sonic Youth t-shirt—looked her up and down with the particular disdain only nineteen-year-olds could muster.

"Yeah?"

Not "What can I get you?" or "Welcome in." Just *yeah*, like her presence was already an inconvenience.

The old Vesper would have mumbled her order apologetically, maybe over-tipped to compensate for existing. But that version felt like something she'd shed somewhere between the tanning bed and this grey Saturday morning.

"Americano. Double shot." She held his gaze until he looked away first. "And make it actually hot this time, yeah? Last place gave me lukewarm piss."

Where had that come from? The casual vulgarity, the demanding tone? It should have felt foreign in her mouth. Instead, it felt like breathing.

The barista's sneer flickered. "Sure. Six forty."

She paid and claimed a corner table with sight lines to the door. The café was trying too hard—exposed brick, mismatched vintage furniture, a chalkboard menu with unnecessary umlauts. Trust-fund bohemia for people who needed their rebellion sanitized.

Her reflection caught in the window glass. Four days of the patch and three tanning sessions, and the changes were undeniable now. Her skin had taken on the faintest golden undertone, nothing dramatic yet, but enough to make her features pop differently. She'd left her hair down again, wild waves she hadn't bothered to straighten. The lipstick was darker today—a muted burgundy that made her mouth look bruised and bee-stung.

The dress was new. She'd gone shopping yesterday after school, skipping department meeting without a second thought. In the fluorescent hell of the mall, surrounded by mannequins in clothes meant for women half her age, something had possessed her. The red bodycon dress clung to curves she'd spent years hiding. Too short, too tight, too *much*. She'd bought it anyway, along with the strappy heels that made her calves flex with each step.

Standing in the dressing room mirror, she'd felt a flush of shame that immediately transmuted into liquid heat between her thighs. The disconnect should have alarmed her. Instead, she'd touched herself right there, one hand braced against the mirror, biting her lip to stay quiet while fluorescent lights buzzed overhead.

Now, in the café, she crossed her legs and felt the whisper of bare thigh against bare thigh. No tights today. November chill be damned.

Marcus arrived at 10:03, fashionably late but not egregiously so. He spotted her immediately, and something flickered across his face—surprise? appreciation?—before smoothing into professional warmth.

"Vesper. You look..." He sat across from her, setting his messenger bag aside. "Well."

"Different." She supplied the word he was dancing around. "I look different."

"Healthy. You look healthy." His eyes dropped to her chest—just for a second, but she caught it. Felt it like fingers brushing her skin. "The patch is agreeing with you."

"That's one way to put it." She leaned forward, elbows on the table. The dress's neckline gaped. Marcus's gaze stuttered. "I feel like I'm rewiring. Every day, I wake up and my old life fits worse. Like I'm outgrowing it."

"That's the cognitive enhancement aspect." He spoke in his pharmaceutical voice now, smooth and practiced. "LUMEN-7 doesn't just address physical fatigue. It optimizes neural pathways, helps you recognize and shed behavioral patterns that no longer serve you."

"Behavioral patterns." Vesper laughed, surprising herself with the harsh edge of it. "Is that what we're calling my entire personality?"

A beat of silence. Marcus studied her with new intensity. "Are you experiencing any adverse effects? Mood swings? Impulsivity?"

"I went tanning." The words came out before she'd decided to say them. "Three times this week. I've never tanned in my life. My mother used to say it was 'common.'" She loaded the word with all her mother's posh disdain. "But now I can't stop thinking about it. That feeling—God, nothing's ever felt like that."

Marcus's expression shifted into something harder to read. "The patch can intensify pleasure responses. It's designed to rewire how you experience reward."

"It's working."

He ordered his own coffee—black, no sugar—and they sat in complicated silence. Around them, the café hummed with weekend energy. Laptops glowing. Conversations murmuring. A girl at the next table scrolled through TikTok, volume low but audible. Some influencer demonstrating a makeup technique, her accent thick Essex.

Vesper found herself watching, transfixed. The girl on the screen had orange-bronze skin, white-blonde extensions, eyebrows drawn on in severe arches. She was demonstrating contouring, her long acrylic nails clicking against a makeup palette.

"...so basically, yeah, you wanna go like, three shades darker than your actual skin, innit? Really carve out them cheekbones. Don't be scared of it, babes. More is more."

The accent scratched something in Vesper's brain. That particular working-class Essex inflection she'd spent her entire academic career training out of her own speech. Her mother's voice echoed: *We don't talk like that, Vesper. We're not common.*

But the girl looked so confident. So unapologetically herself. Fake and proud of it.

"Everything okay?" Marcus's voice pulled her back.

"Fine." She tore her gaze away from the screen. "Just... observing."

"You're a teacher. Occupational hazard." He smiled, but his eyes stayed sharp. "Listen, I should be honest about something. LUMEN-7 isn't just a wellness supplement. It's designed for behavioral modification. We've been testing it on people who want to make significant lifestyle changes—weight loss, addiction recovery, that kind of thing."

Vesper's pulse quickened. "What kind of behavioral modification?"

"It lowers inhibitions around behaviors the subject unconsciously desires but has been socially conditioned to suppress." He spoke carefully now, watching her reaction. "Essentially, it quiets the voice that says 'you can't' or 'you shouldn't.' For most people, that means finally having the confidence to start that business or leave that dead-end relationship. For you..."

"For me?" She leaned in closer. The patch burned against her stomach, or maybe that was just her blood running hot.

"I think you know." His voice dropped. "You're not happy, Vesper. You haven't been happy in years. You've built this prison out of 'supposed to'—supposed to be professional, supposed to be respectable, supposed to live a certain way because someone somewhere decided that's what educated women do. The patch is just... opening the door."

"And what's outside the door?"

"Whatever you want."

The words hung between them like a dare. Vesper's phone buzzed. Her mother, probably, with another passive-aggressive text about Sunday dinner. She silenced it without looking.

"The tanning," Marcus continued. "That's your body recognizing what it actually craves. Not what you've been told to crave. What you *actually* want. The UV exposure triggers endorphin production, yes, but the patch amplifies that reward signal, makes it impossible to ignore. You're not becoming someone new. You're just finally becoming yourself."

"Myself." Vesper tasted the word. "I don't even know who that is anymore."

"Maybe that's the point. Maybe you get to decide."

She thought about yesterday. Standing in front of her closet after the second tanning session, she'd found herself sneering at her professional wardrobe. All those cardigans and khakis suddenly looked like costumes, like something a woman named Vesper would wear but not someone named... what? She'd caught herself imagining a different name. Something sharper, cheaper. Something that would make her mother wince.

"There's a club," Marcus said suddenly. "In Southend. Not your usual spot, I'm guessing. But interesting. Mixed crowd—uni students slumming it with the locals. The kind of place where no one from your world would ever go."

"Why are you telling me this?"

"Because I think you're curious. Because I think part of you wants to see what happens if you step outside your carefully constructed box." He pulled out his phone, typed something. "I'm texting you the address. Go tonight. Dress however makes you feel powerful. See what happens."

Her phone buzzed. She stared at the message without opening it.

"This is insane," she said. But her voice lacked conviction.

"Probably." Marcus stood, dropping cash on the table for his untouched coffee. "But you've been playing it sane for thirty-seven years. How's that worked out?"

He left her there, pulse hammering, skin humming with something that felt like fear and hunger twisted together until they were indistinguishable.

The girl at the next table had moved on to a new video. A nightclub tour. Strobe lights and packed bodies. Girls in bandeau tops and thigh-high boots, screaming along to grime music, makeup melting under the heat. They looked trashy. Common. Absolutely free.

Vesper watched until her coffee went cold. Then she opened Marcus's text and saved the address.

Tonight. Why the hell not?

The patch pulsed against her skin like a second heartbeat, and somewhere in her rewiring brain, LUMEN-7 flooded her system with dopamine, whispering that every boundary existed only to be crossed.

### The Cognitive Shift

# Chapter 5: The Cognitive Shift

The bass hit Vesper's sternum like a physical force. *Ministry*, the club called itself—some wannabe ironic name that probably seemed clever to the twenty-two-year-old who'd chosen it. She'd circled the block three times before parking, her hands slick on the steering wheel, watching girls teeter past on heels that could puncture concrete.

They looked nothing like her students. Nothing like her colleagues. Nothing like anyone in her carefully curated world.

They looked like freedom wearing too much highlighter.

The bouncer barely glanced at her ID. "Tenner, love."

*Love.* When had anyone called her that? The casual endearment slid through her like warm honey. She paid, got her hand stamped with something that glowed purple under blacklight, and pushed through the doors into calculated chaos.

The air tasted like sweat and vanilla vape clouds and something chemical she couldn't name. Bodies packed the dance floor—a writhing mass of spray tans and crop tops, boys in tight shirts that showed off gym memberships, girls who'd transformed themselves into creatures of pure id. The music hammered at frequencies designed to bypass thought entirely, to reduce consciousness to pure sensation.

Vesper stood frozen in the entrance, overdressed in her red bodycon, underprepared for everything else. A girl stumbled past—maybe twenty, maybe younger, impossible to tell under the contouring and false lashes—clutching her friend's arm, both of them shrieking with laughter at some private joke. Their accents were thick enough to cut, all dropped consonants and glottal stops, the kind of speech Vesper had spent four years at university learning to suppress.

*We don't talk like that. We're not common.*

Her mother's voice. Always her mother's voice.

But watching these girls—their unselfconscious joy, their absolute lack of shame—something in Vesper's chest cracked open. They didn't look ashamed. They looked like they'd never heard of shame. Like someone had forgotten to install the mechanism that made you hate yourself.

She pushed toward the bar. The bartender was male, early thirties, tattooed forearms and a smile that had calculated her net worth in seconds. "What can I get you?"

"Vodka." She had to shout over the music. "Just vodka."

"Mixer?"

"No."

His eyebrows rose but he poured. Double shot in a plastic cup. She paid, tipped too much, drank it in two pulls. The alcohol burned down her throat and exploded in her stomach, mixing with the low-grade fever that had been building since the tanning bed that afternoon.

Three sessions yesterday. She'd gone three times in twelve hours, ignoring Kayleigh's warnings about moderation, chasing that purple-light euphoria until her skin glowed pink and hypersensitive. Standing under the shower afterward, the water had felt like a thousand tiny mouths kissing every inch of her flesh.

She'd touched herself again, water cascading over her shoulders, and the orgasm had been so intense she'd had to bite down on her own wrist to keep from screaming.

Now, the vodka hit her bloodstream and the club's heat pressed in and Vesper felt her carefully constructed personality start to pixelate at the edges. The part of her that fact-checked student essays and color-coded her lesson plans tried to assert itself—*this is beneath you, this is dangerous, this isn't who you are*—but the voice sounded distant, irrelevant.

The patch burned against her lower abdomen. Or maybe that was just her body temperature spiking. Hard to tell anymore.

She ordered another vodka. Drank it faster.

The music shifted—some grime track she didn't recognize but felt in her teeth. The crowd's energy shifted with it, and Vesper found herself moving toward the dance floor like something caught in a current. Bodies pressed close on all sides. The smell of too much perfume and sweat and something else, something animal and urgent.

A boy—*man*, he was probably twenty-five but looked younger under the strobes—materialized beside her. "You here alone?"

She should have said no. Should have made up a boyfriend waiting in the bathroom, anything to maintain appropriate boundaries. Instead: "Yeah."

"Brave." He smiled. Nice teeth. Dead eyes. "I'm Connor."

"Vesper."

"That's a mad name. Posh, innit?"

Something about the word *posh* scraped against her spine. She'd spent so long trying to be posh, to sound posh, to erase every trace of her actual origins. Her mother had been a secretary who married a junior solicitor and spent the rest of her life cosplaying as upper-middle-class. Vesper had inherited that performance, polished it until it became indistinguishable from authentic.

But the girl in the red dress, skin still thrumming from UV exposure, three vodkas deep—she didn't feel posh. She felt *common* in the best possible way.

"Yeah," she said, matching his dropped consonant. "Well posh, me."

Connor laughed and moved closer. His hand found her hip, and the old Vesper screamed somewhere deep in her rewiring brain. But the signal couldn't get through. The patch had done something to her inhibitions, filed them down until they no longer locked into place.

She let him pull her into the dancing crowd.

They moved together—if you could call it dancing. More like controlled collision, bodies pressed too close, his hands sliding lower, her hips rolling against him without conscious decision. The music pounded and the lights strobed and Vesper felt herself fragmenting. Part of her watched from above, horrified. But that part was shrinking, drowning under waves of pure physical sensation.

This was wrong. She knew it was wrong. Connor was young enough to be a former student. This club was everything she'd defined herself against. But knowing and caring were two different things, and the patch had severed the connection between them.

Connor's mouth found her ear. "Wanna get some air?"

The smoking area sprawled behind the club—a concrete patio enclosed by chain-link fence, decorated with dead plants in plastic pots. Girls clustered in tight groups, sharing cigarettes and secrets. Boys vaping, comparing tattoos. The November cold bit through Vesper's dress but felt good against her overheated skin.

Connor produced a pack of Marlboro Golds. "Want one?"

Vesper stared at the offered cigarette. She'd never smoked. Never even been tempted. The health risks, the smell, the way it stained everything it touched—her rational mind recited the litany of reasons to refuse.

But she took it anyway.

He lit it for her, cupping his hand around the flame, and she inhaled. The smoke hit her lungs like a fist and she coughed, eyes watering, throat burning. It was disgusting. Harsh and bitter and everything she'd expected.

She took another drag.

This time her body remembered something ancient, something cellular. The nicotine hit her bloodstream and her brain lit up like a Christmas tree. Every receptor suddenly online, suddenly *screaming*. The patch amplified the signal until pleasure and poison became indistinguishable, and somewhere deep in her rewriting neurons, a new pathway carved itself: *this is good, this is right, this is what you need*.

"Easy." Connor laughed. "First time?"

She nodded, unable to speak, smoke leaking from her nostrils. It looked wrong. Felt wrong. But wrong was starting to feel like the only thing that mattered.

A girl nearby—early twenties, orange tan, white-blonde extensions—looked over. "Aw, babe, you're gonna make yourself sick. Here—" She demonstrated, taking a long, smooth drag and exhaling with practiced ease. "You gotta let it sit in your mouth first, yeah? Then breathe it in gentle. Like that."

Vesper tried to copy her. The smoke went down smoother this time, and when she exhaled, it felt like releasing something poisonous that had been trapped inside her for decades.

"There you go!" The girl grinned. "You're proper getting it now. I'm Chantelle."

"Vesper."

"That's a lush name, innit?" Chantelle's accent was thick enough to drown in—pure Essex, unapologetic and loud. "You come here a lot? Haven't seen you before."

"First time."

"Ah, virgin territory! I love it." Chantelle looped her arm through Vesper's with casual intimacy. "You here with him?" She nodded at Connor.

"Just met him."

"Fair play. He's fit enough." She leaned in conspiratorially, smelling like vanilla body spray and vodka Red Bull. "But between you and me, babe, he's a proper fuckboy. You want a good time, go ahead. But don't give him your real number, yeah?"

The casual vulgarity should have shocked Vesper. Instead, it felt like another lock clicking open. *Fuckboy*. When had she last said *fuck* out loud? Years, probably. Decades. Nice girls didn't swear. Educated women maintained decorum.

But standing in the smoking area at midnight, the cigarette burning between her fingers feeling better than it had any right to, Vesper thought: *fuck decorum*.

"Thanks for the warning," she said, and meant it.

Chantelle pulled out her phone. "Here, give us your Insta. We'll go out proper sometime, yeah? I can show you the good places. There's this club in Basildon—absolute scenes on a Saturday."

Vesper hesitated. Her Instagram was a graveyard of book photos and inspirational teaching quotes. Nothing from the last six months. Nothing real.

She rattled off her handle anyway.

Chantelle followed her, then squealed. "Oh my God, you're a teacher? That's mad! You don't look like a teacher."

"I don't?"

"Nah, you look—I dunno. Like you're fun? Most teachers look proper miserable. No offense."

None taken. Vesper took another drag, getting the hang of it now. The nicotine buzz made everything shimmer at the edges. Fun. When had she last been fun? When had she last been anything except competent?

Connor reappeared, sliding his arm around her waist with presumptive intimacy. "Ready to get out of here?"

The smart move was obvious. Thank him, call an Uber, go home. Grade the essays waiting in her bag. Prepare Monday's lessons. Be the person she'd spent fifteen years becoming.

Instead, Vesper flicked her cigarette butt into the ashtray and said, "Yeah. Let's go."

Chantelle caught her eye, grinned, and gave her a thumbs up. Like they were conspirators. Like this was normal. Like every woman spent Saturday nights turning into someone unrecognizable.

Maybe they did. Maybe Vesper had been the only one performing sanity all along.

She let Connor lead her through the club, past the dance floor, into the cold November night. His hand in hers felt wrong but she held on anyway, because wrong was the only thing that made sense anymore.

The patch burned against her skin, and in her rewiring brain, LUMEN-7 continued its patient work—pruning away inhibitions, amplifying reward pathways, teaching her body to crave everything she'd been taught to fear.

Behind them, Chantelle lit another cigarette and took a photo for her Instagram story. The flash caught Vesper's silhouette disappearing into the darkness, red dress blazing like a warning sign.

Or an invitation.

### The Collapse

# Chapter 6: The Collapse

Connor's flat smelled like weed and old takeaway. Third floor of a council block in Southend, the kind of building Vesper had driven past her entire life without really seeing. The lift was broken, graffitied with territorial markers she didn't understand. They'd climbed the stairs with her heels clicking on concrete, his hand on her lower back, proprietary and confident.

Inside, he didn't bother with small talk. Kissed her against the closed door, tasting like cigarettes and Red Bull, his hands already pulling at the red dress. Some distant part of Vesper's consciousness shrieked in protest—*you don't know him, this is dangerous, this is insane*—but the signal couldn't penetrate the fever burning through her veins.

She kissed him back, aggressive, biting his lower lip hard enough to make him gasp. He laughed and shoved her toward the bedroom, and she went, already unzipping, already gone.

The sex was unremarkable. Fast, transactional, neither particularly good nor terrible. Connor finished in less than ten minutes, rolled off her, checked his phone. "You wanna stay? I got work at nine."

"I should go."

She dressed in the dark, her body still humming with unsatisfied energy. The orgasm had been elusive, dancing just out of reach, and now she felt hollowed out, restless. On the nightstand, his pack of Marlboro Golds caught the streetlight filtering through thin curtains.

"Can I...?" She gestured.

"Help yourself."

She took three cigarettes, slipping them into her clutch like contraband. Connor walked her to the door, kissed her perfunctorily, and she descended back into the November cold.

Four AM. The roads were empty except for night buses and black cabs. Vesper sat in her car outside the council block, hands shaking, and lit one of the stolen cigarettes. The smoke curled through her open window, mixing with the smell of sex and regret.

*What have I done?*

The question arrived with perfect clarity. No answer followed.

She drove home on autopilot, nicotine buzzing in her blood, the patch burning against her abdomen like a brand. Her studio apartment waited in reproachful silence—all those carefully alphabetized books, the framed doctorate on the wall, the lesson plans stacked on her desk. Evidence of a life she no longer recognized.

In the bathroom mirror, a stranger stared back. Smudged lipstick, mascara bleeding into shadows under her eyes. Hair wild and sex-tangled. She looked debauched. Cheap. Exactly like her mother had always warned her not to become.

The rational part of her brain—the part that still functioned, that still remembered who Dr. Vesper Irons was supposed to be—finally broke through the fog. *This is the patch. This is the drug. You need to take it off. Now.*

Her fingers found the edge of it beneath her dress. Just one pull and this nightmare would end. She could call in sick Monday, ride out whatever withdrawal came, go back to being herself. Maybe see a doctor. Maybe file a report against Marcus for—what? Giving her exactly what some suppressed part of her had always wanted?

*Pull it off. Pull it off right now.*

But her hands wouldn't move. Or couldn't. Or—worse—*wouldn't let themselves*.

Because underneath the horror, underneath the shame, something else pulsed. A dark satisfaction. The memory of Connor's hands on her body, of dancing in that crush of strangers, of Chantelle's easy acceptance, of the cigarette smoke filling her lungs with poison that felt like medicine.

She'd spent fifteen years being good. Being respectable. Being everything a woman with a doctorate should be. And what had it gotten her? An empty apartment, a job that paid thirty-eight thousand pounds a year, and a future that stretched ahead in beige monotony until retirement or death, whichever came first.

But tonight—for those few hours in the club, in Connor's bed, behind the chain-link fence with nicotine lighting up her brain—she'd felt *real*. Dangerously, powerfully, undeniably real.

Her fingers fell away from the patch.

*No. No. This is the drug talking. This is exactly what it's designed to do. You need to—*

Her phone buzzed. Marcus.

*How was your evening?*

She should block his number. Should document everything and contact whatever medical board governed pharmaceutical trials. Should protect herself and whoever else he'd dosed with his behavioral modification poison.

Instead, she typed: *I fucked a stranger. Smoked cigarettes. I don't even know who I am anymore.*

The reply came immediately, like he'd been waiting.

*You're becoming who you actually are. The patch doesn't create desires, Vesper. It just removes the barriers that kept you from acting on them. Every choice you made tonight was YOURS. That's what terrifies you. Not the drug. The freedom.*

She stared at the words until they blurred. Was that true? Had some part of her always wanted this? The thought was more horrifying than external compulsion. At least a drug could be blamed. But if this was just... her, stripped of social conditioning...

*I need to take it off.*

*Do you? Or do you just think you're supposed to want to take it off?*

Her thumb hovered over the screen. The question wormed into the cracks in her resolve, finding purchase, growing roots.

*This isn't me.*

*Then who is?*

She had no answer. The woman who'd spent Saturday nights grading papers? The one who'd let her doctorate gather dust while teaching twelve-year-olds about metaphor? The one who'd disappeared so thoroughly into respectability that even her own mother called only out of obligation?

That woman felt like a stranger now. A performance she'd mistaken for identity.

Vesper set the phone down and ran the shower. The water was scalding, almost painful, and she stood under the spray until her skin glowed pink. The patch stayed put, waterproof and insistent. When she finally emerged, the stranger in the mirror looked even more vivid. The golden undertone from the tanning sessions was deepening, making her eyes look brighter, her features sharper.

She looked... good. Better than good. Alive.

*Tomorrow I'll take it off,* she promised herself, climbing into bed naked, sheets cool against her hypersensitive skin. *Tomorrow I'll fix this.*

But tomorrow was Sunday. No obligations. No reason to be Dr. Irons. Maybe one more day wouldn't hurt. One more tanning session. One more cigarette. Just to understand what was happening to her. Just to maintain control over the situation.

The rationalizations came easily now, slipping past her defenses like water through cracks. By the time she fell asleep, the patch had burrowed deeper into her consciousness, and the woman who'd driven home in horror was already fading, replaced by something hungrier, something that had finally tasted freedom and found it delicious.

In her dreams, she was orange-bronze and laughing, speaking in an accent that would make her mother weep, surrounded by people who didn't care about her doctorate or her carefully constructed respectability. They cared only that she was real, raw, unashamed.

When she woke Sunday afternoon, mouth dry and head pounding, her first thought wasn't shame.

It was: *When can I go back to Sun Kissed Paradise?*

And she knew, with crystalline certainty, that the patch would never come off. Not because she couldn't remove it, but because she no longer wanted to.

The collapse was complete. What came next was transformation.

---

**State:** Day 8 - Resistance phase terminated. Subject has accepted behavioral modification as authentic desire revelation. Patch removal ideation present but overridden by dopamine reward architecture. First sexual encounter with stranger completed. Nicotine addiction establishing secondary dependency loop. Tanning bed compulsion intensifying. Prefrontal cortex inhibition declining 68%. Identity dissolution accelerating. Subject now actively rationalizing transformation as liberation. Essex accent integration beginning conscious adoption phase. Point of no return achieved.

**Title:** The Collapse

### Metamorphosis

# Chapter 7: Metamorphosis

Monday arrived with migraine clarity. Vesper called in sick again—her voice perfectly calibrated somewhere between professional concern and genuine distress. Principal Harper sounded skeptical but accepted it. Two days in one week was unusual for her, but technically allowed.

The moment she hung up, relief flooded through her so intensely it felt sexual. No Room 214. No parent conferences. No performing competence for people who'd stopped seeing her years ago.

She was *free*.

The thought should have terrified her. Instead, it felt like the first deep breath after years underwater.

Sun Kissed Paradise opened at nine. Vesper arrived at 9:07, still wearing yesterday's dress, mascara smudged into bruises under her eyes. Kayleigh looked up from her phone and did a double-take.

"Bloody hell, babe. Rough night?"

"Something like that." Vesper's voice came out rougher than usual, smoke-damaged. She liked the sound of it. "Can I do a session?"

"You were here Saturday. Twice." Kayleigh pulled up her account, frowning at the screen. "Your skin needs recovery time, yeah? You're gonna burn if you keep—"

"I'll sign whatever waiver you need." Vesper leaned on the counter, close enough to see her reflection in Kayleigh's phone screen. Wild-haired and feral. "I know the risks. I want a session."

Something in her tone made Kayleigh's professional concern evaporate. "Fair play. Bed seven, twelve minutes, level two. But seriously, babes—you might wanna ease up after this. Your skin's already coming up lovely. Don't wanna overdo it."

Vesper paid and headed back. In the small room, she stripped completely this time, no hesitation. Her reflection in the mirror showed the changes accelerating. The golden undertone had deepened to something richer, more deliberate. Her body looked different too—not thinner exactly, but more *present*. Like someone had turned up the saturation.

She climbed into the bed, pulled the lid down, and surrendered to the purple heat.

This time, the euphoria arrived immediately. No build-up, no transition—just instant flooding warmth that turned her bones to liquid. Her back arched off the acrylic and a sound escaped her throat, half-gasp and half-moan. The bulbs pressed down like a lover's weight, and she felt her cells opening, drinking in the radiation like it was the only thing keeping her alive.

Maybe it was.

The twelve minutes felt both infinite and instant. When the timer clicked off, Vesper lay gasping in the sudden darkness, skin screaming with sensation, wetness between her thighs that had nothing to do with sweat. She touched herself right there in the tanning bed, quick and desperate, and the orgasm crashed through her like a religious experience.

*This is addiction,* the small, dying voice of Dr. Irons whispered. *This is what addiction feels like from the inside.*

But that voice sounded distant now, irrelevant. Like hearing someone speak a language you'd once known but had forgotten.

She dressed slowly, savoring the drag of fabric against her hypersensitive skin. In the mirror, her face looked flushed, almost feverish. Pupils blown wide despite the bright lights. She looked high. Fucked. Transformed.

She looked *proper fit*, as Chantelle would say.

The thought arrived in Chantelle's accent—that thick Essex drawl Vesper had spent years training out of her own speech. But hearing it in her internal monologue felt natural now. Right. Like code-switching in reverse, dropping the performance of posh for something more authentic.

Because that's what it had been, hadn't it? A performance. Her mother's working-class shame projected onto her daughter, polished until the origins disappeared. But the accent had always been there, buried under layers of elocution lessons and university affectation. Vesper—*that* Vesper, the one in cardigans and reading glasses—had been the costume. This? This was real.

She stopped at Boots on the way home, moving through the aisles with new purpose. The makeup section that she'd avoided for years suddenly made sense. She loaded her basket: foundation three shades darker than her natural tone, bronzer in a compact the size of her palm, false lashes that looked like small animals, lip liner in brown, glossy nude lipstick, brow pencil, highlighter that promised "blinding glow."

At the hair section, she grabbed bleach and toner. Platinum blonde. Why the fuck not?

The girl at the register—maybe nineteen, orange-tanned with drawn-on brows—grinned at her selections. "Someone's doing a full transformation, innit?"

"Yeah." Vesper matched her accent without thinking. "Proper needed it, to be fair."

"I rate that. You're gonna look lush."

Back in her studio apartment, Vesper stood in the bathroom and stared at the woman in the mirror. Still too much of the old her. Still too much beige respectability clinging to her like dead skin.

She mixed the bleach according to the box instructions and applied it with methodical precision. While it processed—forty-five minutes, timer set—she opened her laptop and searched "Essex makeup tutorial."

Hundreds of results. She clicked the first: a girl named Chloe demonstrating a "full glam" routine. Twenty-three minutes of contouring and highlighting, brows drawn on in severe arches, lashes applied in thick strips. The finished result looked almost cartoonish, aggressively feminine, unapologetically fake.

It looked perfect.

Vesper studied each step, taking mental notes. The language Chloe used—"proper blend it out, babes," "don't be scared, more is more," "we want that Instagram baddie vibe, yeah?"—felt like learning a dialect she'd always known but never spoken aloud.

When the timer went off, she rinsed the bleach and stared at the result. Her hair had lifted to pale yellow-white, slightly fried but exactly right. She toweled it roughly, applied the toner, waited another twenty minutes.

The final result: platinum blonde with slightly darker roots showing through. It made her skin look even more golden, her eyes huge and luminous. She looked cheap. Common. Absolutely transformed.

*Mum would die,* she thought, and smiled.

The makeup took two hours. She followed Chloe's tutorial obsessively, blending foundation that was too dark until her face looked carved from bronze. Contour in the hollows of her cheeks, highlighting the high points until her face looked almost sculptural. Brows drawn on thick and severe. False lashes applied with steady hands. Lip liner overdrawn, glossed until her mouth looked pornographic.

When she finished, a different woman stared back. Not Vesper Irons, PhD. Not a middle school teacher. Just a girl who looked like she'd be comfortable behind the chain-link fence at Ministry, cigarette in hand, accent thick and unapologetic.

She looked proper *Essex*. Proper *common*. Proper *herself*.

The transformation was complete. Or nearly. One thing remained.

Vesper opened her closet and pulled everything out. All the cardigans, the khakis, the sensible flats. She stuffed them into bin bags with savage efficiency. These clothes belonged to a dead woman. A ghost she'd been performing.

In the back, she found old clothes from before university. Tight jeans she'd hidden away, crop tops her mother had forbidden. She pulled on the jeans—tighter now but in a good way—and a white crop top that showed off her newly bronzed midriff.

Her phone buzzed. Chantelle.

*Babe! Wanna come out Friday? Bringing the girls to Ministry. You'll love them x*

The old Vesper would have made excuses. Would have protected her professional reputation. Would have maintained appropriate boundaries.

But that Vesper was suffocating in bin bags, waiting for the charity shop.

*Proper up for it. Can't wait babes x*

She hit send and felt the last tether snap. The patch pulsed against her abdomen—or maybe that was just her elevated body temperature, her rewritten cells celebrating their liberation.

In the mirror, the Essex girl smiled back. Platinum hair, orange-bronze skin, makeup thick enough to withstand a nuclear blast. She looked like every girl Vesper had ever judged, every working-class woman she'd been taught to fear becoming.

She looked fucking beautiful.

Her doctorate stared at her from the wall—*Dr. Vesper Irons, Post-Colonial Feminist Narratives*—a monument to someone who'd never really existed. Just a performance of respectability for an audience that had never truly been watching.

She took it down and shoved it under the bed. That world was done. That woman was dead.

What emerged from the chrysalis had a new name waiting, something that felt right in a way Vesper never had. Something proper Essex. Something real.

The transformation was complete. Tomorrow, she'd walk into Room 214 looking like this, and watch her old life burn.

She couldn't fucking wait.

### Epilogue

# Chapter 8: The New Normal

The November rain drummed against the flat's window, but inside, warmth pooled like honey. Vesper—no, not Vesper anymore, that name belonged to a ghost—*Vee* stretched across the bed, one leg draped over the duvet, watching her reflection in the mirrored wardrobe door.

Proper fit, she looked. Three months of twice-daily tanning sessions had turned her skin a deep, almost unnatural bronze that held even through winter. Her platinum extensions—sixty quid from that girl in Basildon—cascaded over her shoulders in waves that looked expensive even though they weren't. The makeup was automatic now: foundation four shades too dark, contour carved so deep it looked like face paint in natural light, brows drawn on in severe arches, lashes so thick they cast shadows.

She looked like every girl she'd once judged. And fuck, she loved it.

"Babe, you coming or what?" Chantelle's voice carried from the living room. "Candice is already at Liquid, innit. Says it's proper rammed."

Vee rolled off the bed—*Chantelle's* bed now, since she'd moved in six weeks ago. Her studio had been too quiet, too full of ghosts. Here, she split rent with three other girls in a two-bedroom council flat in Southend, and every night felt like a party waiting to happen.

She pulled on her outfit: white bodycon dress that barely covered her arse, thigh-high boots in patent leather, jacket with fur trim that was definitely fake but looked lush. The cigarette pack in her bag was almost empty—she'd need to grab more before the club. She was up to nearly a pack a day now, and the morning cough barely registered anymore.

In the bathroom, she touched up her lips while Chantelle leaned against the doorframe, scrolling through her phone. "You seen this?" She turned the screen. Instagram post from someone called *TeacherBae.2024*—a video of students in a classroom, their teacher looking proper miserable in a cardigan and khakis.

Vee squinted at it. Something about the image tugged at her memory, like déjà vu from a dream she couldn't quite remember. Had she known someone who looked like that once? Worked somewhere with fluorescent lights and institutional beige?

The thought evaporated like smoke. "Fuck me, she looks depressing."

"Right? Imagine being that boring." Chantelle applied another layer of gloss. "Thank God we ain't stuck in some dead-end job, innit?"

Vee nodded, though her actual job situation was... complicated. She'd stopped showing up to school in early December. There'd been calls from Principal Harper, then from HR, then from her union rep. She'd ignored them all. Eventually, a formal termination letter arrived.

She'd burned it in the kitchen sink while Chantelle filmed for TikTok.

Money came easier now anyway. The club promoters paid her to show up, to bring her girls, to look good and keep the energy high. Fifty quid here, a hundred there. And then there was Marcus's other offer—the one that had made sense somewhere around week eight, when rent was due and her bank account was screaming.

"Gentlemen's entertainment," he'd called it. Upscale private parties. Men with money who wanted pretty girls who knew how to be fun, uncomplicated. The first time, she'd done it with four vodka Red Bulls in her system and Chantelle holding her hand in the taxi. By the fifth time, she'd stopped counting the money and started counting the hours until the next tanning session.

Her phone buzzed. Marcus.

*Party in Mayfair tomorrow night. Eight girls needed. £500 each plus tips. You in?*

Her fingers moved automatically. *Proper up for it. Count me in babes x*

Chantelle grinned. "Another one?"

"Mayfair this time."

"Fucking hell, moving up in the world." She pulled Vee into the living room where Kayleigh—from Sun Kissed Paradise, now flatmate number three—was pre-gaming with Smirnoff Ice. "Vee's got us a Mayfair gig."

"Yes babe!" Kayleigh raised her bottle. "Told you that tan would pay off. You're proper glowing lately."

Vee smiled and accepted the offered drink. The vodka slid down easy, barely registering. Her tolerance had shot up along with everything else—more alcohol, more cigarettes, more everything. The patch still lived against her lower abdomen, though she'd stopped noticing it weeks ago. It was just part of her body now, like her belly button or the small tattoo she'd gotten last week (a butterfly on her hip, done drunk at 2 AM in someone's kitchen).

Madison Carver's face flickered through her mind—some memory of a girl with bitten nails and thoughtful eyes. A student? Had she been a teacher once? The thought felt absurd. That required qualifications, responsibility, giving a fuck about things that didn't matter. She couldn't imagine doing any of that now.

"Ready then?" Chantelle grabbed her bag. "Uber's two minutes away."

They tumbled out into the rain, shrieking and laughing, piling into the car with too much perfume and not enough clothing. The driver's eyes found Vee in the rearview mirror, lingering on her chest, and she felt that familiar warm flush of power. Men looked at her now. Wanted her. Would pay for her. It made everything else irrelevant.

Ministry's queue stretched down the block, but they walked straight to the front. Jordan the bouncer—who Vee had fucked twice now, proper good shags—waved them through with a grin. Inside, the bass hit like a drug, and the crowd parted for them because they looked proper lush, all of them, golden and platinum and loud.

Vee lit a cigarette on the dance floor—fuck the rules—and let some boy whose name she didn't know press against her from behind. The smoke curled toward the ceiling and she felt complete. This was it. This was everything. No thoughts about lesson plans or parent conferences or dissertations gathering dust. Just bodies and bass and the beautiful simplicity of being desired.

At 3 AM, she'd end up in someone's bed—whose didn't matter. At noon tomorrow, she'd wake up and go to Sun Kissed Paradise for her sessions, letting the UV radiation flood her system with that purple-light euphoria. At 8 PM, she'd put on something expensive-looking and take a car to Mayfair, where men in suits would pay her to be exactly what she'd become: empty, available, uncomplicated.

The patch hummed against her skin, indistinguishable now from her own heartbeat. LUMEN-7 had done its work perfectly, pruning away everything complex, everything difficult, everything *her*—replacing it with pure, mindless efficiency. A body that craved only pleasure and profit, that had forgotten how to question or resist.

In the club's bathroom, Vee checked her makeup in the mirror between two girls doing lines off the sink. The reflection showed someone completely transformed: orange-bronze skin, platinum hair, makeup applied with the precision of ritual. She looked proper Essex. Proper *common*. Exactly like she was supposed to be.

Behind her eyes, where Dr. Vesper Irons had once analyzed post-colonial narratives and worried about student outcomes, there was only quiet. Content, unthinking quiet. The fever had burned away everything that wasn't essential, and what remained was perfect in its simplicity.

She smiled at her reflection, reapplied her lip gloss, and went back to the dance floor where Chantelle was grinding on some footballer's mate. The music pounded and the bodies pressed close and Vee felt happy in a way that required no thought, no analysis, no understanding.

Just pleasure. Just profit. Just the beautiful emptiness of a transformation complete.
