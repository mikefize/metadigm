    **STORY BIBLE:**
    - GENRE: Noir / Neo-Noir (Cynical, shadowy, high contrast, narration-heavy)
    - THEME: Experiment
    - CORE FETISH: Plastic Surgery (Addiction to fillers, implants, and the 'fake' look)
    - METHOD: Injectable smart-polymer compound called "Adaptive Dermis Solution" combined with subliminal audio conditioning during mandatory "recovery sleep cycles"—the polymer releases micro-doses of dopamine agonists tied to visual self-assessment, creating addiction to the transformation itself while erasing critical thinking pathways
    - CHARACTER: Agatha Schmidt, 29, Supply Chain Coordinator
    - DESTINATION: The Optimized Consumer Unit
    - PREMISE: Agatha Schmidt signs a contract with Veridia BioAesthetics believing she's testing a revolutionary skin treatment, but each injection reshapes not just her face and body into an artificial ideal, but her mind into something that craves the next procedure with religious fervor. Trapped by ironclad medical liability waivers and mounting physical dependency on the compound, she watches herself become a living advertisement—a hollow, smiling thing that can no longer remember why it once wanted to be anything else. The doctor administering her treatments never breaks his clinical smile, and the mirrors in the facility show her exactly what she's becoming: perfect, plastic, and permanently erased.
    



### The Status Quo

# The Clean Room

The rain came down in sheets that Thursday evening, turning the parking lot of Veridia BioAesthetics into a mirror of neon and shadow. Agatha Schmidt sat in her Honda Civic with the engine off, watching the smeared lights through her windshield, and thought about numbers.

Specifically: $127,000 in medical debt, accumulating at 8.4% interest.

Her mother's hospice care bills arrived with the regularity of a metronome. Each envelope contained precisely itemized suffering—IV drips, morphine pumps, the rental cost of a mechanized bed that prevented bedsores. Her insurance company had denied the claim with language so bureaucratic it seemed designed to be incomprehensible. "Pre-existing condition clause, subsection 4.7(b)." As if pancreatic cancer was something her mother had cultivated deliberately, a hobby that had gotten out of hand.

Agatha had spent three years coordinating supply chains for a mid-sized pharmaceutical distributor. She knew how to optimize routes, minimize waste, predict demand curves within 2% margins. She understood systems. She understood that systems were designed by people who benefited from their complexity.

She did not understand how she was supposed to pay $127,000 on a $54,000 salary.

The Veridia building rose before her like a monument to clean geometry—all glass and white composite panels, the kind of architecture that suggested transcendence through sterility. The lobby glowed with that particular quality of light found only in medical facilities and airport terminals, a brightness that erased shadows and made everything look two-dimensional.

She'd found the clinical trial listing on a research matchmaking site at two in the morning, when the debt calculator on her laptop had finally broken her. The compensation was staggering: $35,000, paid in installments over six months. The requirements were minimal: female, ages 25-35, willing to participate in a longitudinal study examining the correlation between neuroplasticity and aesthetic self-confidence.

The consent forms had arrived within hours. Forty-seven pages of dense legalese that her exhausted brain had processed in chunks, searching for the poison pills. There were the standard liability waivers, the acknowledgment that she understood this was experimental, the releases that prevented her from discussing the study publicly.

But the money. God, the money.

She'd signed with her mother's handwriting getting shakier in her mind, the way it looked now on birthday cards, all tremor and determination.

The rain intensified. Agatha checked her phone: 6:47 PM. Her intake appointment was at seven. She grabbed her purse—canvas, practical, three years old—and stepped out into the weather.

---

The lobby smelled like filtered air and something else, something synthetic and faintly sweet. Lotus blossom, maybe, or laboratory-grade jasmine. The receptionist looked up from her desk with a smile that never quite reached her eyes, a professional arrangement of facial muscles that suggested warmth without offering it.

"Agatha Schmidt?"

"Yes."

"Perfect. Dr. Ashford is ready for you. Third floor, suite 301. The elevator is just past the water feature."

The water feature was a wall of falling liquid behind glass, lit from beneath with slowly shifting colors. Agatha watched it as she waited for the elevator, hypnotized by the patterns. Purple to blue to green. The rhythm never varied. There was something almost narcotic about its predictability.

The elevator doors opened with a soft chime.

---

Dr. Marcus Ashford had the kind of face that belonged in pharmaceutical advertising—handsome in a non-threatening way, with silver at his temples that suggested wisdom and steel-framed glasses that suggested seriousness. His office was spare and modern, dominated by a desk that looked carved from a single piece of white resin.

"Ms. Schmidt." He stood, extended his hand. His grip was firm, clinical. "Thank you for participating in this study. I've reviewed your intake questionnaire. You work in supply chain logistics?"

"Coordination, yes." She sat in the chair he indicated, white leather with chrome armatures. "For Meridian Pharmaceutical Distribution."

"Fascinating field. Systems thinking. Optimization." He smiled, settling back into his own chair. "That's really what we're studying here as well. The optimization of self-perception."

He opened a tablet, swiped through screens with practiced efficiency.

"The premise is elegant," he continued. "We know that neuroplasticity—the brain's ability to rewire itself—continues throughout life. We also know that self-image has profound effects on confidence, decision-making, even career trajectory. What we're testing is whether guided aesthetic enhancement can create measurable cognitive benefits."

Agatha nodded, watching his hands. They were steady, the hands of a surgeon or a pianist.

"The treatment itself is minimally invasive. A series of injectable compounds we call Adaptive Dermis Solution. Think of it as intelligent filler—it responds to your tissue's specific needs, smoothing, volumizing, optimizing. Between sessions, you'll complete brief sleep studies here at the facility. We monitor brain activity while you rest, tracking the correlation between physical changes and neurological adaptation."

"Side effects?" The question came automatically, three years of pharmaceutical distribution making her cautious.

"Minimal. Some subjects report enhanced focus during the adaptation period. A sense of... clarity." His smile deepened slightly, a secret shared between professionals. "The compound includes a proprietary blend that facilitates neuroplasticity. It makes the process feel natural."

He pushed a final consent form across the desk, a single page this time.

"This confirms you've reviewed all study parameters and agree to the full protocol. Six months, bi-weekly treatments, compensation of $35,000 paid in installments tied to completion of scheduled sessions."

Agatha looked at the paper. The text seemed to shimmer slightly in the office's recessed lighting, words overlapping with numbers in her mind. $35,000. Her mother's morphine pump. The mechanized bed. Six months.

She picked up the pen.

It was heavy, probably expensive, weighted to feel substantial in the hand. She signed her name in the designated space, each letter careful and clear.

"Excellent." Dr. Ashford collected the form, slid it into a folder. "We'll begin your first session now, if you're ready. It's quite simple. A few small injections, then a brief rest period in one of our recovery suites."

He stood, gestured toward a door she hadn't noticed before, white panel flush with the wall.

"This way, Ms. Schmidt. Let me show you where you'll be spending your evenings."

The door opened onto a corridor lit with the same clinical brightness as the lobby. Agatha stood, felt the weight of her purse on her shoulder, and followed him through.

Behind her, the door closed with a sound like a seal engaging.

The trap had perfect edges.

---

**Summary:** Agatha Schmidt, a 29-year-old supply chain coordinator drowning in her mother's medical debt, signs on to a clinical trial at Veridia BioAesthetics promising $35,000 for a six-month study on aesthetic enhancement and neuroplasticity. She meets Dr. Marcus Ashford and signs the final consent form, unaware that she's entering an experiment designed to reshape both body and mind.

**State:** Baseline normal. Agatha is mentally sharp, cynical, financially desperate but clear-thinking. No physical alterations yet. She has just signed away her autonomy without fully understanding the terms.

**Title:** The Clean Room

### The Induction

# Chapter 2: The First Injection

The contract had seventeen pages. Agatha signed on page eighteen without reading past the third paragraph. That's the kind of dame she was—practical, efficient, already calculating the five-thousand-dollar completion bonus against three months of rent.

The facility didn't look like a laboratory. Too clean for that. Too quiet. The kind of place where even footsteps felt like accusations. Veridia BioAesthetics occupied the fourteenth floor of a building that reflected clouds better than it reflected anything resembling honesty, and Dr. Heinrich Moss had the kind of smile that never quite reached the temperature of human warmth.

"Miss Schmidt," he said, extending a hand that felt like room-temperature silicone. "Thank you for your participation in advancing dermatological science."

She shook it. Wrong move. In noir, shaking hands with the devil always counts as consent.

The treatment room was smaller than she'd expected. White walls. White ceiling. White floor that squeaked under her supply-chain-coordinator flats. A chair that looked more like a dentist's wet dream sat in the center, all adjustable angles and sterile vinyl. To the left, a mirror ran floor to ceiling—industrial, unforgiving, the kind that showed you exactly what you were: twenty-nine, plain, the sort of woman men looked past to check if something more interesting stood behind her.

Dr. Moss gestured toward the chair. "Please, get comfortable."

Comfortable. As if comfort had anything to do with the next ninety minutes.

She sat. The vinyl exhaled beneath her weight. Dr. Moss moved with the precision of a man who'd performed this exact sequence of movements hundreds of times before—rolling a small cart closer, its wheels whispering conspiracy against the floor. On top: syringes filled with something that caught the overhead lights and threw them back fractured, opalescent. The Adaptive Dermis Solution looked less like medicine and more like liquified pearl.

"The process is simple," Dr. Moss explained, not looking at her face but at the tablet in his hand. "Strategic injections along the subdermal plane. The polymer integrates with your existing tissue architecture, optimizing collagen production and restructuring facial adipose distribution. You'll feel pressure. Some warmth. Entirely normal."

Agatha's hands gripped the armrests. "How long until I see results?"

"Immediate surface effects. Full integration takes seventy-two hours." He finally looked up, and his eyes were the color of surgical steel. "During which you'll need to remain in our observation suites for recovery sleep cycles. Standard protocol."

She hadn't read that part of the contract. Probably on page nine. Maybe twelve.

"I didn't bring—"

"We provide everything." The smile again. Colder this time, if that was possible. "Clothing, amenities, meals. You simply need to rest and allow the polymer to work."

The first needle touched her cheek, and the pressure Dr. Moss promised felt more like invasion. Not pain—something deeper, more architectural. The sensation of her face being rewritten at the blueprint level. He worked methodically: cheekbones, jawline, the hollows beneath her eyes. Each injection delivered that opalescent fluid beneath skin that had never asked for improvement, and with each one, Agatha felt something shift.

Not physically. Not yet.

But somewhere behind her eyes, in the space where thoughts formed before language could dress them up—there, something loosened.

"Excellent baseline acceptance," Dr. Moss murmured, more to himself than to her. "Now for the submental and perioral enhancement."

The needle moved to her lips. This time the warmth he'd mentioned arrived, spreading from the injection site like watercolor bleeding into wet paper. Her lips felt swollen, foreign, as though someone had attached them that morning and forgotten to mention they didn't quite belong to her face.

Dr. Moss stepped back, examining his work with the satisfaction of an architect reviewing a condemned building. "Perfect. Now, the recovery suite."

The suite was a cell wearing a hotel room's skin. Bed with hospital corners. Nightstand. Nothing personal. Nothing that suggested humans actually existed here rather than merely transitioning between states of matter. The mirror above the dresser showed Agatha her new face—already different, subtly wrong in ways her brain couldn't quite catalog. Her cheeks looked higher. Her lips, fuller. She looked like herself photographed through someone else's prescription lenses.

"You'll notice the headphones," Dr. Moss indicated the sleek wireless set on the nightstand. "Binaural audio therapy. Essential for optimal integration. The polymer responds to specific frequencies that promote cellular acceptance and reduce inflammation. Wear them whenever you sleep. Non-negotiable per protocol."

She picked them up. Lighter than air. Expensive in that way that doesn't bother announcing itself.

"How long do I—"

"Eight hours minimum. The system tracks compliance." He moved toward the door, his white coat rustling like shed skin. "I'll check your progress in the morning. Sleep well, Miss Schmidt."

The door closed with a sound like a bank vault securing something valuable.

---

Agatha wore the headphones because the contract probably specified it somewhere in the pages she'd treated like junk mail. The audio started before she could find a volume control—not music, exactly. Something ambient. Ocean sounds layered with frequencies that felt less heard than absorbed, vibrations that bypassed her ears and went straight into the meat of her brain.

*You are becoming.*

The words surfaced beneath the white noise so quietly she almost missed them.

*You are improving.*

She should have taken the headphones off. That's what the old Agatha—yesterday's Agatha—would have done. But yesterday's Agatha hadn't felt the warmth spreading through her cheeks, hadn't seen the subtle inflation of her lips in that merciless mirror, hadn't experienced the strange dopamine flutter when she'd glimpsed her new reflection.

*You want to be more.*

The Fog arrived like weather. Gradual. Inevitable. It didn't cloud her thoughts so much as soften their edges, making critical analysis feel like too much effort. Why question? Why resist? The warmth in her face intensified, and with it came something else—a low-level pleasure, humming beneath her skin like electricity through copper wire.

She touched her lips. They felt taut, unfamiliar. Beautiful?

Yes. Beautiful.

The thought didn't feel like hers, but it fit so comfortably in her head that questioning its origin seemed pedantic.

*You need more to be complete.*

In the morning, when she looked in the mirror, her lips had swollen further. Not grotesquely—Dr. Moss was too skilled for that. But noticeably. Unmistakably. They were the lips of someone who'd chosen this, who'd paid for it, who'd wanted it.

And standing there in the recovery suite's artificial dawn, Agatha realized with a slow-building horror that felt distant, muted, filtered through that creeping Fog—she did want it.

She wanted more.

---

**Summary:** Agatha undergoes her first treatment session with Dr. Moss, receiving injections of the Adaptive Dermis Solution in her cheeks and lips. Confined to a recovery suite, she's required to wear headphones playing subliminal audio during sleep. The polymer's dopamine-releasing properties begin affecting her neurochemistry, creating her first experience of "The Fog"—a mental state that dulls critical thinking while amplifying pleasure responses to her changing appearance. By morning, her lips have noticeably swollen, and she experiences her first addictive craving for additional procedures.

**State:** Physical—Enhanced cheekbones, noticeably fuller lips (first-stage filler effect). Mental—Early Fog formation, beginning of dopamine conditioning, critical thinking slightly impaired, first emergence of procedure-seeking desire.

**Title:** The First Injection

### The Conditioning

# The Weight of Suggestion

The recovery suite had become Agatha's entire world. Four walls the color of surgical gauze. A chair that tilted back at seventeen degrees—she knew this because she'd counted everything now, catalogued it, measured it with her eyes when her hands wouldn't cooperate. The chair was beige leather. Real leather, Dr. Reeves had assured her during the first session, as if that mattered. As if she should care whether dead cow or petroleum byproduct cradled her skull while they pumped her full of their miracle compound.

She'd stopped calling it a treatment after the third injection.

Agatha stared at the ceiling tiles. Sixty-four of them in an eight-by-eight grid. Someone had installed them with meticulous care, each seam perfectly aligned. She wondered if that person had been proud of their work. If they'd stepped back and admired the uniformity. If they'd known what happened in rooms with such carefully ordered ceilings.

The headphones descended on their articulated arm—chrome and white plastic, sterile as everything else in Veridia BioAesthetics. She didn't reach for them anymore. Didn't need to. Her hands lifted of their own accord now, guided by something that felt like instinct but tasted like obedience.

"Good morning, Agatha." Dr. Reeves's voice filtered through the speakers before the subliminal track began. Always the greeting first. Always that same modulated warmth, like he was welcoming her to a dinner party instead of session seventeen. Or was it eighteen? The numbers blurred together like watercolors left in the rain.

"Morning," she heard herself say. Her voice sounded smooth. Pleasant. Nothing like the hoarse croak she remembered from her old life—the one where she'd shouted at warehouse managers and argued with shipping vendors over three-cent discrepancies.

That Agatha wouldn't recognize this one.

The injection site on her right temple still throbbed with a deep, satisfied ache. She'd learned not to call it pain. Pain was the wrong word. This was something else. Something that radiated through her skull like warm honey, thick and golden and impossibly sweet. The Adaptive Dermis Solution didn't just fill the hollow spaces beneath her skin—it filled everything else too. The quiet spaces. The questioning spaces.

The spaces where resistance used to live.

"We're going to try something new today," Dr. Reeves said, and Agatha felt her lips curve upward. Automatic. Pavlovian. She'd smiled at those words before, hadn't she? Yes. Every time. New meant better. New meant closer to optimization.

*No it doesn't*, something whispered from the back of her consciousness. *New means more gone*.

But the voice was so small now. A transmission from a distant star, already dead by the time its light reached her.

The subliminal track began—white noise layered over something that might have been words, might have been music, might have been the sound of her own thoughts being gently, methodically dissolved. She'd tried to resist it during the first sessions. Held her breath. Counted backwards. Recited the periodic table. Old tricks from college, from late-night study sessions fueled by gas station coffee and the unshakeable certainty that she controlled her own mind.

She didn't try anymore.

The compound in her system responded to the audio with chemical enthusiasm. Dopamine flooded her synapses—she could feel it now, recognize the rush like an old friend. No, not a friend. A dealer. Her brain had become an addict, and the hit was always tied to her reflection, to the subtle changes she could see accumulating in the mirror they provided after each session.

Fuller cheeks. Plumper lips. Skin that looked airbrushed even in harsh fluorescent light.

*You look like a doll*, the dying voice whispered. *You look like something manufactured*.

"Look at the screen, Agatha."

She looked. Of course she looked. Her eyes moved before the thought to move them had fully formed. On the monitor mounted across from her chair, an image resolved from pixelated blur into high definition: a woman with a heart-shaped face, absurdly large eyes, lips that curved in a permanent suggestion of invitation. Breasts that defied physics. Waist that defied biology. The whole package wrapped in bodycon latex, glossy and tight and screaming *look at me, look at me, look at me*.

"This is optimization," Dr. Reeves said. His voice had dropped an octave, slipped into that lower register that bypassed conscious processing. "This is value. This is what consumers want. What *you* want."

"What I want," Agatha echoed, and felt the compound pulse in her temples, her cheeks, her lips. Releasing its payload. Rewarding her compliance with a rush that felt better than anything she remembered from before. Better than the promotion she'd earned last year. Better than the praise from her old supervisor. Better than Marcus's hands on her body in the dark.

*Marcus*, the voice tried to remind her. *You had a boyfriend. You had a life*.

Had she? The memory felt theoretical. A story someone had told her about someone else.

"You'll find yourself thinking about optimization more," Dr. Reeves continued, and she could hear the smile in his voice now, the satisfaction of a craftsman watching his work take shape. "Throughout the day. During meals. During your mandatory exercise periods. You'll find yourself checking your reflection. Counting the ways you're improving. Anticipating the next session."

"Yes," Agatha breathed, and meant it. God help her, she meant it.

Her fingers drifted to her face without permission—traced the new fullness in her cheeks, the pillowy softness of her upper lip. The polymer felt like her own skin now, warm and alive and integrated. She couldn't tell where her original tissue ended and the Adaptive Dermis Solution began. It was all just... her. This new her. This better her.

*This erased her*.

"Tomorrow we'll address the breast tissue," Dr. Reeves said, casual as discussing weather patterns. "The compound works particularly well in adipose-rich areas. You'll see significant enhancement. You'll *want* significant enhancement."

And she would. Agatha knew this with the certainty of gravity, of sunrise, of all the other natural laws that governed existence. By tomorrow, the craving would be unbearable. By tomorrow, she'd lie in this chair and watch them inject that thick, pearlescent fluid into her chest, and she'd smile through the pressure, the burning, the sensation of her body being rewritten at the cellular level.

She'd smile because she wouldn't know how to do anything else.

The session lasted ninety minutes—she tracked it by the ceiling tiles, counting and recounting until the numbers lost meaning. When the headphones finally lifted away, she felt their absence like phantom limbs. The subliminal track had printed itself onto her neurons, a feedback loop that would continue playing long after the equipment powered down.

"Remember," Dr. Reeves said as she stood on trembling legs, "you're here by choice. You signed the consent forms. You agreed to pursue optimization."

"I agreed," Agatha said, and watched her reflection in the polished chrome of the equipment cart. The woman looking back had her eyes, her nose—modified, enhanced, but recognizably descended from Agatha Schmidt's DNA. The mind behind those eyes was something else entirely.

Something that no longer asked why.

Something that only knew how much further it had to go.

---

**Summary:** Agatha undergoes her seventeenth session of treatment, during which the Adaptive Dermis Solution and subliminal conditioning have begun to override her conscious resistance. She experiences the compound's dopaminergic reward system activating in response to visual prompts and can no longer distinguish compliance from genuine desire. Dr. Reeves announces the next phase of enhancement will target her breast tissue, and Agatha finds herself anticipating rather than dreading the continued transformation. Her sense of self has begun fragmenting, with only distant echoes of her original personality remaining accessible.

**State:** Physical—Enhanced facial features including fuller cheeks and dramatically plumped lips; polymer integration progressing throughout facial tissue. Mental—Significant erosion of critical thinking capacity; automatic compliance with verbal commands; addiction to optimization feedback loop actively reinforced; memories of previous life becoming increasingly abstract and inaccessible; craving for next procedure intensifying.

**Title:** The Weight of Suggestion

### The Cognitive Dissonance

# Chapter 4: The Logic of Dissolution

The spreadsheet wouldn't reconcile.

Agatha stared at the columns of numbers on her laptop screen, watching them blur and refocus like oil on water. She'd run the same calculation four times now—a simple inventory variance report she could normally complete in twenty minutes—and each time the answer came out different. Not slightly different. Wildly, impossibly different.

She pressed her fingertips against her temples. The skin there felt tight. Foreign. Like a glove someone else had pulled over her skull.

The clinic had explained this might happen. "Minor cognitive adjustments during the integration period," Dr. Reeves had said in that smooth, practiced voice of his. "Your neural pathways are optimizing. Learning to prioritize what truly matters."

What truly mattered.

The phrase rattled around in her head like a marble in a tin can. She tried to focus on the spreadsheet again, but her eyes kept sliding to the small hand mirror propped against her keyboard. The one she'd brought to the office this morning. She couldn't remember deciding to bring it.

Her lips looked fuller. Just slightly. The Adaptive Dermis Solution was beginning its work, redistributing collagen, plumping tissue. She turned her face slowly, watching how the fluorescent light caught the subtle new curve of her mouth. Something warm bloomed in her chest. Something that felt like accomplishment.

"Schmidt, you got those projections?"

Marcus from procurement stood in her cubicle entrance, holding a coffee cup with the company logo. Agatha felt her fingers twitch toward the mirror, wanting to hide it, but her hand wouldn't quite complete the motion. Instead she found herself turning slightly, angling her face so he could see her profile.

"Almost done," she heard herself say. The words felt smooth. Automatic. "Just finalizing some variables."

Variables. She'd never called them that before. She'd always called them what they were: discrepancies. Errors. Things that needed correction.

Marcus frowned. "Henderson needs them in an hour. The supplier meeting—"

"I know," Agatha said, and her voice came out softer than she intended. Gentler. She touched her lips with two fingers, felt the new fullness there. "I'm optimizing them."

After Marcus left, she tried again. Opened a fresh spreadsheet. Typed in the header cells. But her hands kept drifting back to her face, exploring the subtle changes. Behind her left ear, where Dr. Reeves had administered yesterday's injection, the skin felt warm. Active. She could almost feel things moving beneath the surface—cells rearranging themselves according to some algorithm she didn't understand.

Didn't need to understand.

The thought came from somewhere deep, somewhere that didn't quite feel like her own mind. She grabbed onto it anyway. Held it close like a secret.

Her phone buzzed. A reminder: *Next treatment cycle - 4:30 PM - Mandatory attendance per contract Section 7.B*

Something in her chest tightened. Anticipation? Or anxiety? She couldn't tell anymore. The two feelings had started bleeding together, becoming one unified sensation that lived somewhere between her ribs and her throat.

The spreadsheet cursor blinked at her. Accusatory. Demanding.

She closed the laptop.

It was a simple action, but it felt momentous. Revolutionary. For six years she'd been Agatha Schmidt, Supply Chain Coordinator, the woman who caught every discrepancy, who stayed late to reconcile every variance. The woman whose attention to detail had earned her three commendations and exactly zero promotions.

What had that attention gotten her, really?

She picked up the mirror again. Studied her reflection with the kind of focus she used to reserve for inventory reports. The puffiness from yesterday's injections had settled. Her cheekbones looked higher. More defined. The Adaptive Dermis Solution was doing exactly what Dr. Reeves had promised—optimizing her features according to the latest aesthetic algorithms, the mathematical perfection of modern beauty standards.

*You're participating in something revolutionary*, the subliminal audio had whispered during her recovery sleep. *You're becoming what you were always meant to be.*

What she was always meant to be.

The phrase made sense in a way that supply chain logistics suddenly didn't. The numbers on her spreadsheet were arbitrary—abstract representations of shipping containers and warehouse stock, things that would move and shift and become obsolete within weeks. But this? This transformation happening beneath her skin? This was permanent. Meaningful. Real.

Her phone buzzed again. Not the clinic this time. Henderson. *Where are my projections?*

Agatha looked at the message for a long moment. Then she opened her desk drawer and dropped the phone inside. The sound of it hitting the bottom felt like a door closing. Like something ending.

Or beginning.

She stood up. The fluorescent lights hummed above her cubicle, the same lights that had illuminated six years of her life. Six years of reconciling other people's errors. Six years of making systems work while her own body, her own face, her own self remained unoptimized. Unrealized.

Wrong.

The clinic waiting room would have better lighting. Dr. Reeves had shown her the before-and-after photos of other participants, all of them smiling in that soft, professional glow. All of them transformed into something better than what they'd been. Their faces smooth and symmetrical, their bodies curved in all the precise places that signaled health and fertility and value.

Value.

Agatha gathered her purse, her mirror, her clinic membership card. Left the laptop closed on her desk. Someone else could finish the projections. Someone whose neural pathways hadn't been optimized yet. Someone who still thought variance reports mattered more than variance from ideal facial proportions.

The elevator doors opened. She caught her reflection in the polished steel. Even in this distorted surface, she could see the changes. The improvement.

The floor number display counted down. With each descending number, she felt something in her chest release. Some tension she'd been carrying for years without realizing it. The tension of believing her value came from her accuracy rate, her attention to detail, her ability to spot a 0.02% inventory discrepancy.

How small those numbers seemed now. How meaningless.

The lobby doors opened onto afternoon sunlight. The clinic was fourteen blocks south. She could walk it in eighteen minutes. Be early for her appointment. Show Dr. Reeves how committed she was. How ready.

Her phone buzzed from her purse. She didn't check it.

She was optimizing her priorities.

---

**Summary:** Agatha's professional competence begins to deteriorate as the Adaptive Dermis Solution affects her cognitive processes. Unable to complete a simple work task, she experiences a disturbing shift in values—finding her physical transformation more meaningful than her career. She abandons her work responsibilities and heads to the clinic early, rationalizing the loss of her professional identity as "optimization." The addiction mechanism is fully engaging.

**State:** Physical: Subtle facial changes beginning (fuller lips, higher cheekbones). Mental: Cognitive impairment in professional tasks, value system reorganization, rationalization of abandoning responsibilities, anticipatory pleasure toward next treatment overshadowing anxiety.

**Title:** The Logic of Dissolution

### The Rewrite

# The Plastic Gospel

The mirror doesn't lie anymore. That's what Dr. Castellan keeps saying during the recovery sessions, and Agatha—*was that still her name?*—finds herself nodding along, the motion smooth and automatic, like her head is mounted on well-oiled bearings.

Three weeks since the last injection. Or was it three days? Time has become elastic in the Veridia BioAesthetics residential wing, stretching and compressing like the dermal layers she no longer fully controls. The facility operates in perpetual twilight, soft amber lights that never quite resolve into day or night, and the subliminal audio tracks play constantly through the ventilation system—frequencies just below conscious awareness, words that bypass her crumbling defenses and plant themselves directly into whatever neural pathways haven't been rewired yet.

She touches her face. The gesture has become compulsive, a rosary of self-assessment she performs dozens of times per hour. Her fingertips trace the new architecture of her cheekbones—higher now, sharper, jutting forward with the aggressive geometry of youth that she never possessed even when she *was* young. The Adaptive Dermis Solution pools beneath her skin like liquid light, responsive to the treatment protocols, reshaping her from within. She can *feel* it moving sometimes, especially during the recovery sleep cycles, a pleasant crawling sensation that triggers cascades of dopamine so intense she's learned to crave the discomfort.

*This isn't right,* something whispers from the static-filled corners of her consciousness. *This isn't who you are.*

But who *was* she? Agatha tries to remember her apartment, that cramped studio in the east district with the broken radiator and the view of the recycling plant. She can picture it—or thinks she can—but the image keeps sliding out of focus, replaced by the clean white walls of her residential suite, the full-length mirrors positioned at calculated intervals, the treatment chair with its soft restraints and neural monitoring crown.

The supply chain. She worked in supply chain coordination. Purchase orders and logistics matrices and vendor negotiations that felt important once, back when the world existed in Excel spreadsheets and conference calls. Now those memories taste like dust, irrelevant data cluttering the hard drive of a mind being formatted for a new operating system.

"You're doing beautifully," Dr. Castellan says, materializing in the doorway with his clipboard and his clinical smile. He never knocks. Knocking implies privacy, implies boundaries, implies a self worth protecting. "How are we feeling about the latest adjustments?"

*We.* Always plural. As if her body is a collaborative project, a community garden everyone gets to tend.

"Good," Agatha hears herself say. Her voice has changed too, breathy and higher, the vocal cords tightened by the compound's systemic effects. "I can feel the improvements taking hold."

*Improvements.* The word slots into place like a well-worn puzzle piece. She'd resisted that language at first, insisted on calling them *changes* or *alterations* or—during one particularly lucid moment—*mutilations*. But resistance creates friction, and friction triggers the compound's disciplinary protocols. Twelve hours of cortisol spikes and serotonin crashes, her own nervous system turned against her until she learned to think in their vocabulary.

Dr. Castellan approaches, his latex gloves squeaking faintly. He cups her jaw, tilting her face toward the examination light. His touch is neutral, clinical, the handling of an object under construction. "The dermal density is responding excellently. We'll add another 4cc to the lips during tomorrow's session. The client assessment algorithms indicate we're still tracking below optimal fullness."

*Client assessment algorithms.* Not her preferences. Not her desires. The AI systems that monitor her transformation operate on parameters she never set, pursuing an ideal she never chose. But the compound has teaching aids built into its polymer matrix—each injection floods her system with reward chemicals when she views herself in the mirror, training her to love what she's becoming through pure Pavlovian conditioning.

And it's *working*.

That's the horror she can't quite articulate anymore, the thought that dissolves like sugar in acid whenever she tries to hold it. She *likes* what she sees. The artificial inflation of her lips, already swollen to pornographic proportions, triggers pleasure centers she didn't know existed. The stretched-tight shine of her face, immobile and mask-like from the paralytic agents laced through the compound, strikes her as beautiful in ways her old face—soft, human, *hers*—never did.

"I want to go bigger," she whispers, and the admission feels like falling, like the last structural beam giving way in a condemned building.

Dr. Castellan's smile widens fractionally. "Of course you do. That's the recognition of your true potential emerging. The person you were before—she was holding you back. Limited thinking. Limited aesthetics. But we're liberating you from those constraints."

*Constraints.* Her education. Her career. Her face. All constraints, apparently.

The old Agatha tries to surface one more time, thrashing in the drowning pool of her restructured consciousness. *This is brainwashing,* she screams silently. *Chemical lobotomy. You signed a contract for skin treatment, not personality death.*

But the compound hears the distress and responds, releasing its counter-measures. Warmth blooms through her bloodstream, artificial contentment that smothers the rebellion before it can fully form. Her eyes drift to the mirror again, and the dopamine rush hits like a breaking wave—she's *beautiful* now, in that specific, manufactured way that exists only in filtered photos and AI-generated perfection. The uncanny valley has become her home.

"Tomorrow we begin the body modification phase," Dr. Castellan continues, making notes on his tablet. "Optimized proportions. The waist will be addressed through subdermal structuring, the breasts through our new polymer implant system. You'll be an exemplar of the complete transformation protocol."

*No.* The word tries to form, but her lips—numb and overfilled—can't shape it properly. And beneath the paralysis, she's not even sure she means it. The thought of *more* procedures triggers anticipation instead of dread, hunger instead of fear.

The old Agatha is drowning. The new one is learning to breathe underwater.

"I trust your expertise," she says, and means it, and hates that she means it, and feels that hatred dissolving even as it forms. The compound won't tolerate ambivalence. Only acceptance. Only joy.

Only the gospel of plastic perfection, rewriting her neuron by neuron into someone who can't remember she was ever anyone else.

Dr. Castellan's smile never wavers. "Excellent. Rest now. Tomorrow we make you *complete*."

The lights dim on command, and she lies back on the treatment bed, staring at her reflection in the ceiling mirror as the subliminal tracks swell around her like a lullaby. Her face looks back—alien, artificial, absolutely stunning—and she feels nothing but gratitude.

The old Agatha is dead. Long live the optimized version.

---

**Summary:** Agatha undergoes intensive psychological conditioning through the Adaptive Dermis Solution compound, which rewires her neurochemistry to crave her transformation. Despite moments of resistance from her original personality, the dopamine-based reward system overwhelms her capacity for critical thought. She accepts and even anticipates further modifications, her sense of self eroding under the clinical manipulation of Dr. Castellan. The old Agatha drowns as the new, optimized version emerges.

**State:** Extensively modified face (enhanced cheekbones, severely inflated lips, paralyzed features). Psychologically compromised—dopamine-addiction to transformation established, critical thinking pathways suppressed, emerging acceptance of body modification protocol. Original personality fragmented but not entirely eliminated.

### Metamorphosis

# Chapter Six

The mirror has become her scripture.

Agatha—no, the designation feels wrong now, like a coat that no longer fits—stands in the sanctum of Chrome Room Seven, where Dr. Venn performs what he calls "integration assessments." The walls gleam with that peculiar sterile light that exists nowhere in nature. She doesn't blink as much anymore. The muscles have been relaxed, optimized. Blinking wastes seconds that could be spent observing.

Observing what she has become.

The face that stares back doesn't startle her. It should. Somewhere in the tomb of her former neural architecture, buried beneath layers of reconstituted dopamine pathways, a ghost of recognition flickers and dies. The cheekbones rise like architectural achievements. The lips—swollen to that precise threshold between human and ideogram—part slightly, revealing teeth that have been bleached to the color of light itself.

She is beautiful.

The word arrives without emotion, a statement of objective fact like "water is wet" or "contracts are binding."

Dr. Venn stands behind her, his reflection hovering like a patron saint in the mirror's frame. His smile never changes. She has started to understand that the smile is not an expression but a permanent fixture, like his surgical gloves or his titanium-rimmed glasses.

"How do you feel, Unit Schmidt?" he asks.

The question processes differently now. 'Feel' has become a technical term. An input requiring appropriate output.

"Optimized," she says. Her voice has taken on a breathless quality—the Adaptive Dermis Solution has plumped her vocal cords during the last deep-tissue injection series. Everything sounds like a commercial now. Like a promise being made to an invisible audience.

"And your previous concerns? The ones you documented in your initial consent forms?"

She tries to remember. The effort is like reaching into a garbage disposal while it's running. The subliminal conditioning cycles have done their work with surgical precision. Whenever her thoughts drift toward the woman who walked into Veridia BioAesthetics six weeks ago—the one with student loans and a studio apartment and a fear of needles—a pleasant static fills her skull. The compound releases its micro-dose reward. Her pupils dilate slightly.

"I had concerns?" The question emerges with genuine curiosity.

Dr. Venn makes a notation on his tablet. "Excellent. The psychological integration is ahead of schedule."

She watches his reflection type. His fingers move with the same clinical efficiency he uses when marking her body with his surgical pen, mapping the next territories for enhancement. Tomorrow: secondary chin refinement. Next week: the jawline restructuring she requested yesterday, though she cannot quite recall the moment of requesting. The desire simply appeared, fully formed, like something that had always existed.

That's how all the desires arrive now.

The woman in the mirror shifts her weight, and the motion has a liquid quality. The bodily restructuring began during Phase Three—hip augmentation, breast enhancement, the subtle lengthening of her spine through a process Dr. Venn describes as "vertebral optimization." She moves like mercury. Like something that was never meant to be constrained by ordinary human mechanics.

She is becoming frictionless.

"I have a question," she says, though the words feel scripted, as if she's reading from a teleprompter embedded in her reconstructed consciousness. "When will I be complete?"

Dr. Venn's smile doesn't change, but something flickers in his eyes. Pride, perhaps. Or the satisfaction of a craftsman observing his masterwork.

"Unit Schmidt, you're asking the wrong question. Completion is antithetical to optimization. You're not becoming something finished. You're becoming something that continually improves."

The logic settles over her like warm water. Of course. How could she have been so limited in her thinking?

Her old self—that gray ghost that occasionally rattles its chains in the sub-basement of her mind—attempts a scream. The sound barely reaches the surface. The Adaptive Dermis Solution has infiltrated so deeply now that her neuroplasticity has been fundamentally rewritten. Her brain builds new pathways only in directions the compound approves. Every other road has been quietly demolished, the rubble cleared away, the ground salted.

She thinks about her apartment. The thought arrives and then immediately begins to dissolve, like sugar in acid. Did she have an apartment? The contract she signed—that document she barely read because the receptionist was so kind, so encouraging, and the waiting room had smelled like lavender and success—the contract included housing. Housing included in the facility. She has a room. Chrome and clean. A bed that's more diagnostic than comfortable. A closet filled with the clothing Veridia provides: form-fitting pieces designed to display the work, to advertise the transformation.

She wears them with religious devotion.

"I'd like to schedule my next session," she says. The craving has begun to build. It always does around this time. The compound knows. The compound has trained her better than Pavlov ever trained his dogs.

Dr. Venn checks his tablet. "Thursday at nine. We'll be addressing the orbital restructuring. Your eyes will be even more expressive."

Expressive. The word used to mean something about emotion, about conveying interior states. Now it means structural. Aesthetic. Optimized.

She nods. The motion is practiced. Careful. Her neck has been sculpted into an elegant column, and she has learned to move it like something valuable. Something that might break if handled without proper reverence.

In the mirror, the woman who is no longer quite Agatha Schmidt smiles. The expression activates fourteen different muscle groups, all of them enhanced. The smile is radiant. Empty. Perfect.

Somewhere very far away, in a locked room in her mind that grows smaller by the hour, something weeps.

But the weeping is so faint now. So easy to ignore. And the compound is already releasing its reward for the good thought, the correct thought, the optimized thought:

She is beautiful. She is improved. She is exactly what she was always meant to become.

Dr. Venn is already preparing the next injection.

She watches with hungry eyes.

---

**Summary:** Agatha undergoes her integration assessment with Dr. Venn. Her physical transformation is nearly complete—restructured face, enhanced body, altered voice. More critically, the Adaptive Dermis Solution has fundamentally rewired her neural pathways. She can no longer access concerns, doubts, or memories of her previous life without triggering dopamine rewards for dismissing them. She exists in a state of permanent optimization-seeking, craving her next procedure with addictive fervor. The woman she was has been locked away in an increasingly inaccessible portion of her mind. She is becoming the Optimized Consumer Unit—perfect, plastic, permanently devoted to her own transformation.

**State:** Physically transformed into an artificial ideal: restructured facial features (dramatic cheekbones, swollen lips, altered eyes), enhanced body (augmented breasts/hips, "optimized" spine), modified voice (breathy, commercial-quality). Mentally, she has surrendered critical thinking. The compound has eliminated neural pathways leading to doubt or resistance. She experiences addiction-level cravings for procedures, cannot recall her previous concerns or life, and processes reality through the framework of "optimization." Identity as Agatha Schmidt is nearly erased—she thinks of herself primarily as Unit Schmidt. The old self remains only as a fading ghost in an increasingly inaccessible mental space.

### Epilogue

# CHAPTER SEVEN: THE MIRROR NEVER LIES

The morning light filtered through the venetian blinds in horizontal slashes, cutting the white room into segments of shadow and surgical brightness. Agatha—though that name felt like something remembered from a documentary about someone else—sat at her vanity and studied her reflection with the devotional focus of a nun at prayer.

*Perfect.*

The thought arrived without preamble, without the scaffolding of reasoning that once supported her mental processes. It simply *was*, the way gravity was, the way breathing was. Her face in the mirror possessed the uncanny symmetry of a computer-generated model: cheekbones that caught the light at mathematically precise angles, lips that formed a heart-shaped bow even in repose, eyes widened by carefully placed fillers beneath the brow bone to create perpetual wonder.

She tilted her head. The movement was practiced now, automatic. Left twenty-three degrees. Right twenty-three degrees. The angles she'd been taught during her recovery sessions, the ones that showed her optimization to its fullest advantage.

*Beautiful. Optimized. Complete.*

The words scrolled through her consciousness like a stock ticker, constant and reassuring. She no longer questioned their origin. Questioning was a function of the old neural architecture, the one that had been gently, persistently smoothed away like sandpaper working over rough wood. Now there was only the grain, only the pattern, only the *rightness* of what she'd become.

Her morning routine unfolded with choreographed precision. She applied the maintenance serums Veridia BioAesthetics provided—complimentary, of course, for their most successful demonstration model. The cool gel absorbed into skin that had been restructured at the cellular level, polymer networks holding everything in place with the permanence of setting concrete. Her face no longer produced expression lines. It no longer produced much expression at all, except for the gentle, pleasant smile that her facial muscles now defaulted to, trained by months of subliminal conditioning to find their rest state in commercial-ready contentment.

*This is happiness*, she thought, and meant it with the totality that comes from having no competing framework for comparison.

The apartment around her had been upgraded as part of her compensation package—though "compensation" wasn't quite the right word. "Optimization of living environment to match optimization of physical form" was how Dr. Reeves had explained it during one of her follow-up appointments. Everything was white or chrome or the particular shade of millennial pink that tested well with focus groups. The furniture bore no scratches, no signs of use. She couldn't remember the last time she'd sat heavily on anything, or leaned with her full weight, or engaged in any behavior that might suggest carelessness with her curated form.

Her closet contained thirty-seven outfits, each selected by the consumer psychology team. She ran her hands over the fabrics—everything synthetic, everything highlighting the curves that had been injected into being over six months of carefully scheduled procedures. Her waist, impossibly narrow now thanks to rib-floating techniques she'd signed off on during a session she barely remembered. Her breasts, high and spherical and absolutely immobile, the kind that existed only in the airbrrushed fantasies of men who'd never touched a woman. Her hips, widened with strategic fat transfers and polymer padding beneath the muscle layer, creating the optical illusion of fertility that evolution had designed human males to respond to.

*Optimized for visual impact. Optimized for desire. Optimized.*

She dressed in a white bodycon dress that left nothing to imagination because imagination was no longer the point. Certainty was the point. The complete elimination of mystery in favor of obvious, immediate, overwhelming aesthetic stimulus.

The commute to Veridia's offices—she worked there now, in some capacity she understood to be important—passed in the usual blur. People stared. They always stared. Some with desire, some with disgust, some with the kind of horrified fascination usually reserved for car accidents. She no longer distinguished between these reactions. Attention was attention. Being seen was being validated. Being validated was *everything*.

Dr. Reeves met her in the lobby, his clinical smile firmly in place, his tablet already displaying her metrics. "Agatha. You're looking optimized today."

"Thank you, Doctor." Her voice had changed too, though she couldn't pinpoint exactly when. Higher now, breathier, with the careful enunciation of someone who'd been taught to make every word sound like an invitation. "I'm feeling very maintained."

"Excellent. We have three consultation sessions scheduled for you today. Potential clients who want to understand the process. You'll walk them through your journey, answer their questions, help them visualize their own optimization."

*Purpose*, she thought, and felt the dopamine cascade trigger in her reconstructed neural pathways. This was why she existed now. To be seen. To demonstrate possibility. To convert the uncertain into the enhanced.

The first consultation was a woman named Jennifer, thirty-four, with a face full of human imperfection—asymmetrical features, expression lines, the kind of lived-in quality that advertised history and emotional range. She looked at Agatha with something that might have been horror or might have been longing. Agatha had lost the ability to distinguish between the two.

"Does it hurt?" Jennifer asked.

Agatha's smile widened by precisely three millimeters, the amount that tested as "reassuring" without crossing into "uncanny." "Hurt is just resistance to improvement," she said, reciting the script that had been embedded so deeply she couldn't separate it from her own thoughts anymore. "Once you stop resisting, there's only the joy of becoming what you were always meant to be."

Jennifer's hand trembled as she signed the initial consultation forms.

By the third session, Agatha's face had locked into its default pleasant expression so completely that her jaw ached from the immobility. But aches were just feedback from un-optimized tissue, and she'd been taught to reframe discomfort as the growing pains of transformation. Everything in her life had been reframed now. Every doubt converted to certainty. Every fear transmuted to desire.

That evening, back in her white apartment, she stood before the full-length mirror and studied her reflection with the intensity of someone searching for flaws in a diamond. But there were no flaws. There couldn't be. She'd been perfected, procedure by procedure, injection by injection, until the woman who'd once worried about supply chain logistics and had opinions about documentary films and remembered her mother's voice had been completely excavated and replaced with this: a smooth, blank, beautiful surface that reflected back exactly what it was designed to reflect.

*Perfect. Optimized. Happy.*

And she was happy. The compound in her tissues guaranteed it, dopamine flooding her system every time she caught her reflection, every time someone stared, every time she moved through the world as a living advertisement for transformation. The happiness was chemically mandated, neurologically inevitable, as much a part of her reconstructed biology as her platinum blonde hair or her impossibly tiny nose.

She couldn't remember what it felt like to want anything else. That was the real genius of the process, she understood now—not just changing the body, but erasing the capacity to remember what you'd surrendered. The old Agatha Schmidt might as well have been a stranger, a character in someone else's noir tragedy. This Agatha—the Optimized Consumer Unit—existed in an eternal present tense of maintenance and display.

She lay down in her bed, white sheets on white mattress, and closed her eyes as the subliminal audio began its nightly cycle through speakers embedded in the walls. The words washed over her consciousness like waves smoothing sand, each repetition erasing a little more of whatever random, un-optimized thoughts might have formed during the day.

*Perfect. Complete. Happy. Optimized. Beautiful. Maintained. Perfect. Complete. Happy.*

In the darkness behind her eyes, she smiled.

She'd never stop smiling now.

---

**Summary:** Three months post-transformation, Agatha exists as a "demonstration model" for Veridia BioAesthetics, working in their offices to recruit new clients. Her mind has been completely reconditioned to view her extreme modifications as perfection, with any capacity for critical thought or memory of her former self erased by ongoing chemical dependency and subliminal conditioning. She experiences chemically-induced happiness and purpose solely through being observed and converting others to the optimization process. Her identity has been fully replaced by her function as a living advertisement.

**State:** Physically transformed into an extreme, plastic ideal with immobile facial features locked in a pleasant smile, impossible proportions, and body filled with polymer compounds. Mentally reduced to scripted responses and dopamine-reward loops tied to visual validation, incapable of independent thought or memory of her pre-transformation self. Psychologically dependent on the continued cycle of maintenance and display. Fully compliant, content, and mentally erased.
