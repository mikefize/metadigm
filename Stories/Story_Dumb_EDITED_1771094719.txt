### The Equation

# PRISM

## CHAPTER ONE: THE EQUATION

Fatima Schmidt circled the error in red pen, then added a small annotation in the margin: *Check your signs when distributing negatives.* The fluorescent lights overhead buzzed at 60 Hz—she'd calculated it once during a particularly tedious faculty meeting, counting the oscillations against her watch. The classroom smelled of dry-erase markers and teenage desperation, that particular cocktail of body spray and anxiety that permeated every high school math room in the district.

"Miss Schmidt?" Trevor Vásquez stood beside her desk, his worksheet clutched in both hands like a shield. "I don't get number seventeen."

She glanced at the clock. 3:47 PM. Her office hours technically ended in thirteen minutes, but Trevor had failed the last two quizzes. The quadratic formula stared up from his paper, half-worked, abandoned at the step where *b²* met *-4ac*.

"Show me what you tried first," she said.

His pencil trembled slightly as he pointed to his work. She watched his eyes track the numbers, saw the exact moment confusion crystallized into frustration. That look—she'd spent four years learning to recognize it, to intervene before it hardened into the brittle conviction that math was simply beyond reach.

"Here." She pulled a blank sheet from her desk drawer. "The discriminant tells you how many solutions exist. You're not wrong; you just stopped too early." Her pen moved across the paper in smooth, practiced strokes. "See? Two real roots."

Understanding bloomed across his face like time-lapse photography. That dopamine hit never got old—watching the tumblers click into place behind someone else's eyes.

Her phone vibrated against her hip. She ignored it until Trevor left, his worksheet now covered in her annotations, his shoulders no longer hunched against failure.

The text was from Yusuf: *Call when you can. Not emergency. But soon.*

Her older brother didn't do unnecessary drama. If he said soon, he meant soon.

She locked her classroom at 4:03 PM and called from the parking lot, her sedan ticking as it cooled. Traffic hummed along the overpass a block away—the 405, eternally gridlocked, its exhaust mixing with the petrichor smell that always preceded Los Angeles rain.

"The valve's failing faster than they thought." Yusuf's voice carried that particular flatness he adopted when discussing his own mortality. He'd been born with a bicuspid aortic valve, a genetic coin flip that had landed wrong. "Dr. Mehta wants to move the surgery up. Six weeks, maybe seven."

Fatima's hand tightened around the phone. "Insurance?"

"You know the answer."

She did. The state system covered basic valve replacement—the old mechanical kind that clicked audibly with each heartbeat, required lifelong blood thinners, failed within a decade. The bioengineered valve Yusuf needed, the one with a twenty-year track record and no anticoagulation protocol, existed in a gray zone between experimental and established. Too new for state coverage. Too expensive for cash payment.

"How much?" she asked, though she'd researched the numbers months ago during a sleepless 3 AM spiral.

"Eighty-seven thousand. Plus post-op monitoring."

Her teacher's salary, after taxes and rent on her studio apartment, left approximately fourteen hundred dollars monthly. Her savings account contained nine thousand dollars and thirty-two cents. She'd done this math already, worked it from every angle. The equation didn't balance.

"I'll figure something out," she said.

"Fatima—"

"I will."

She drove home through the gathering dusk, past the neon blur of strip malls and the holographic advertisements that projected across building faces. A woman's face, three stories tall, smiled down from an animated billboard: *NeuroLux Corporation—Optimizing Human Potential.* The slogan rotated through five languages, including Arabic, the letters flowing right-to-left before dissolving into Mandarin.

The NeuroLux ad was still cycling when she pulled into her apartment complex.

She found their trial posting at 11:47 PM, cross-referenced through three medical databases and a research forum she'd joined when Yusuf's diagnosis first came back. Single-participant study. Twelve-week protocol. Payment structure: $8,000 initial, then $7,000 per week upon completion of weekly milestones, with a $15,000 bonus for full protocol completion. Total compensation: $107,000.

The number sat on her screen like a taunt and a lifeline.

She read the consent form three times. The language was dense, full of phrases like "neural pathway optimization" and "cognitive restructuring through targeted stimulation." There, in section 7.4, sandwiched between clauses about data privacy and intellectual property: *"Participants may experience alterations in personality expression, decision-making patterns, and value hierarchies as the PRISM device establishes new reward pathways. These changes are considered core outcomes of the treatment protocol."*

Personality harmonization. That's what they were calling it.

She pulled up Yusuf's surgical timeline in another tab. Consultation in six days. Pre-op bloodwork in three weeks. Surgery window opening in forty-two days.

Twelve weeks. Eighty-four days. The math was simple.

The cursor blinked in the signature field. She thought about Trevor Vásquez and his half-finished quadratic equation, about the moment when understanding clicked into place. She thought about her classroom and the satisfying snap of dry-erase marker against whiteboard. She thought about her brother's laugh, the way he'd taught her to factor polynomials when she was twelve, patient even when she couldn't see the pattern.

She thought about what she stood to lose.

The cursor kept blinking.

At 12:03 AM, Fatima Schmidt typed her name and clicked Submit.

### The Threshold

# CHAPTER TWO: THE THRESHOLD

The NeuroLux building didn't look like a place where people sold pieces of themselves. Glass and steel, forty stories of reflective surfaces that caught the morning sun and threw it back in fragments. The lobby smelled of ozone and something floral—synthesized jasmine, maybe, pumped through invisible vents. Fatima's sneakers squeaked against polished concrete floors that gleamed like standing water.

A woman sat behind a curved reception desk, her face so symmetrical it registered as uncanny. She smiled with perfect teeth. "You must be Subject 19-F. We've been expecting you."

Not Fatima. Subject 19-F. The designation felt like a recalibration, a reminder that she'd already signed away the right to personhood the moment she clicked Submit.

"Fourth floor, Suite 447. Dr. Reeves will handle your intake." The receptionist's eyes didn't quite track Fatima's movement—there was a slight lag, a millisecond delay that suggested ocular implants, the kind that overlaid data feeds directly onto the visual cortex. She was probably reading Fatima's file while maintaining that placid smile.

The elevator played no music. Just the hydraulic whisper of ascent and her own breathing, too loud in the enclosed space. She'd dressed carefully this morning: jeans, a button-down shirt, her teacher clothes. Armor against transformation. In her bag, she'd packed a notebook and three pens, a talisman against forgetting.

Suite 447 opened into a corridor of white walls and chrome fixtures. Overhead, LED panels emitted a daylight-spectrum glow calibrated to suppress melatonin production. Everything was visible. Everything was recorded. She could see the camera bubbles embedded in the ceiling, their red status lights blinking in synchronized rhythm.

Dr. Reeves met her in Room C—a space that straddled the line between medical office and showroom. The chair dominated the center: reclined at thirty degrees, upholstered in something that looked like leather but felt like silicone when Fatima brushed against it. Restraint points at the wrists and temples, though Dr. Reeves didn't mention those.

"Ms. Schmidt. Excellent." Dr. Reeves was forty-something, her hair pulled into a bun so tight it looked surgical. She wore a lab coat over what appeared to be designer athleisure—the kind of outfit that cost more than Fatima made in a week. "We'll begin with baseline measurements today. The PRISM installation is scheduled for your second session, pending your bloodwork and psych evaluation."

She gestured to the chair. Fatima sat, feeling the material adjust beneath her, conforming to her weight distribution with unsettling precision.

"The process is painless," Dr. Reeves continued, attaching sensors to Fatima's temples, her wrists, the base of her skull. "The subdural mesh is nanoscale—it'll integrate with your dura mater over the first seventy-two hours. You won't feel it. What you will notice are the adjustments." She smiled, clinical and detached. "Think of it as... recalibration. Your brain has spent twenty-four years building associations. Mathematics gives you pleasure. Problem-solving triggers dopamine release. We're going to redirect those pathways. Gently. Gradually."

Fatima's mouth had gone dry. "Toward what?"

"Your dossier indicates an aptitude for visual pattern recognition and social dynamics. We'll be enhancing those. De-emphasizing the abstract reasoning circuits." Dr. Reeves pulled up a holographic display, a 3D model of a brain with highlighted regions. "The temporal lobe here—we'll quiet this. The nucleus accumbens, the ventral tegmental area—we'll amplify reward responses when you engage in aesthetic activities. Grooming behaviors. Social performance."

The words landed like physical blows. Grooming behaviors.

"I need to be able to teach," Fatima said. "After this. I need to—"

"You'll retain factual memory. You'll know you were a teacher." Dr. Reeves tapped the display, rotating the brain model. "But the drive to teach, the satisfaction you derive from it—that will be... reallocated."

A technician entered—young, male, wearing a cleansuit that rustled with each movement. He carried a tablet and didn't make eye contact. "Baseline imagery ready, Doctor."

The holographic display shifted. Images began cycling in front of Fatima's eyes, rapid-fire, three seconds each. A chalkboard covered in equations. A lipstick. A graph of polynomial functions. A designer handbag, pink leather with gold hardware. A page from a textbook. A compact mirror. A proof of the Pythagorean theorem. A pair of high heels, stiletto thin, impossibly tall.

Sensors tracked her pupil dilation, her skin conductance, the micro-expressions that flickered across her face before conscious control could suppress them.

The equations made her lean forward slightly. She could feel it happening, that familiar pull of engagement. The handbag registered as noise. Pretty, maybe, but irrelevant.

For now.

"Excellent baseline," Dr. Reeves murmured, studying her tablet. "Strong response to abstract stimuli, minimal reaction to material goods. That's a robust starting point. The transformation will be quite dramatic."

Transformation. Not treatment. Not therapy.

They showed her a video then, projected directly onto the white wall. A woman—Subject 12-F, according to the label—sitting in this same chair. Week One: she wore glasses, spoke in complete sentences about her work as a civil engineer. Week Four: the glasses were gone, replaced by false lashes. Her sentences had started to upturn at the ends, questions where statements should be. Week Eight: she giggled at something off-camera, examining her manicure—long acrylics in bubblegum pink. Week Twelve: she introduced herself as Kiki, blew a kiss at the camera, and said, "I'm, like, totally grateful? For this opportunity to optimize my authentic self?"

The engineer was gone. Kiki remained.

Fatima's hands gripped the chair arms. The silicone material yielded, almost warm, almost alive.

"Any questions before we proceed?" Dr. Reeves asked.

Yes. A thousand. What if I can't afford to do this? What if I can? What happens to the person I am when you're finished rewiring who I want to be?

But Yusuf's surgery was in forty-two days, and the equation still didn't balance without NeuroLux's money.

"No questions," Fatima whispered.

Dr. Reeves smiled and made a notation on her tablet. The camera overhead blinked its steady red heartbeat.

"Then let's begin your optimization, Subject 19-F."

### The First Mark

# CHAPTER THREE: THE FIRST MARK

The subdural mesh arrived in a titanium case no larger than a contact lens container. Dr. Reeves held it up to the light, and Fatima caught a glimpse of something that looked like spun glass, geometric patterns too precise to be natural. Hexagonal structures nested within hexagons, fractal in their repetition. Her brain tried to calculate the mathematics of it—surface area, tessellation patterns—before she remembered that soon, maybe, she wouldn't care.

"Lie back," Dr. Reeves instructed. "The injection site is subcutaneous, just below the occipital bone. You'll feel pressure, then a cold sensation as the mesh deploys. The nanites need approximately forty seconds to navigate into position."

Two technicians flanked the chair. One—the same young man from before, whose name tag read JORDAN—adjusted the restraints at her wrists. Not tight. Just present. A suggestion of what could happen if she struggled.

"Is that necessary?" Fatima's voice came out thinner than intended.

"Protocol," Jordan said. His eyes never met hers. "Some subjects experience involuntary muscle spasms during deployment. We're protecting you."

The chair reclined further, forty-five degrees now, until she was staring at the ceiling tiles. Someone had designed them to look random, but she could see the pattern—a repeating sequence of perforations, every seventh tile rotated ninety degrees. Her fingers twitched, wanting to document it, to map the logic.

Dr. Reeves appeared in her peripheral vision, holding what looked like a modified injection gun. "Small pinch," she said, and pressed the device against the base of Fatima's skull.

The pinch was a lie.

Pain flared white-hot, a needle punching through skin, fascia, the membrane that protected her brain. Fatima's jaw clenched, teeth grinding hard enough that she tasted copper. The restraints went taut as her body tried to arch away from the invasion.

Then: cold.

Not the cold of ice water or winter air. This was deeper, invasive, spreading through the inside of her skull like spilled mercury. She could feel the mesh unfolding—actually feel it, thousands of microscopic threads finding purchase against her dura mater, weaving themselves into the architecture of her thoughts.

"Forty seconds," someone said. Jordan, maybe. His voice sounded distant, underwater.

The cold branched. Fingered its way forward, following the curves of her brain. She wanted to scream but her throat had locked, every muscle rigid with the effort of not moving while something alien rooted itself in her neurons.

Fifteen seconds.

Her vision stuttered. The ceiling tiles fragmented into overlapping images, each one slightly offset from the last. She saw the pattern she'd noticed earlier, but now it was wrong—the seventh tile was the eighth tile was the third tile, all simultaneously, the logic collapsing into recursive nonsense.

Twenty-five seconds.

Pressure built behind her eyes. Not painful, exactly, but present. Insistent. Like her brain was swelling to accommodate the intrusion, making space where no space should exist.

Thirty seconds.

The cold began to warm. She felt her hippocampus lighting up—she knew that's what it was, could visualize the sea-horse curve of it from the anatomy textbooks she'd studied in undergrad biology. Memories flickered: teaching her first class, the way her hand had shaken holding the marker. Yusuf in the hospital bed after his diagnosis, his hand finding hers. Her mother's funeral, the geometric precision of the casket's corners.

The mesh was cataloging. Taking inventory.

Forty seconds.

"Deployment complete," Dr. Reeves announced. "Vital signs stable. Neural integration at seventeen percent and climbing."

The restraints released with a pneumatic sigh. Fatima didn't move. Couldn't. Her body felt distant, a collection of parts she was borrowing rather than inhabiting.

"How do you feel?" Dr. Reeves leaned into view, studying Fatima's face with the detached interest of an entomologist examining a pinned butterfly.

How did she feel?

"Strange," Fatima managed. Her tongue felt thick. "Like... background noise. In my head."

"That's the mesh establishing baseline connectivity. It'll fade over the next few hours as your brain habituates." Dr. Reeves made a note on her tablet. "Any nausea? Visual disturbances?"

"The tiles..." Fatima gestured weakly at the ceiling. "They moved."

"Optical processing recalibration. Temporary." Dr. Reeves smiled, the expression not reaching her eyes. "Your brain is learning to see the world through new frameworks. By next week, you'll wonder why you ever found ceiling tiles interesting."

The casual cruelty of it landed like a slap. Fatima tried to sit up, managed to prop herself on her elbows. The room swayed gently, then settled.

"I'd like you to try something," Dr. Reeves said. She pulled up the holographic display again, the same rapid-fire image sequence from baseline testing. "Just observe. No need to respond."

The chalkboard full of equations appeared first. Fatima's brain reached for them automatically, started parsing the derivatives—

Pain. Subtle but sharp, like touching a hot stove. The dopamine rush she normally felt looking at mathematical notation had been short-circuited, replaced with discomfort. Her eyes watered.

The image changed. Designer handbag, pink leather, gold hardware.

Nothing. Neural silence. The bag registered as an object, a collection of visual data, but triggered no response. Not positive, not negative. Just empty.

"Interesting," Dr. Reeves murmured. "The aversion to mathematics is already manifesting. The reward pathways haven't redirected yet—that will take a few more sessions. But the old associations are weakening right on schedule."

Fatima's stomach clenched. She'd felt that pain. Physical, undeniable. Her own brain punishing her for doing what she'd always done, what defined her.

"It's just..." she started, then stopped. Just what? Just temporary? Just the mesh settling in? Just her personality being dismantled one neural pathway at a time?

"It's the treatment working," Dr. Reeves said, filling the silence. "You're going to feel disoriented for a few days. That's normal. Your brain is in flux. But think about why you're here." She glanced at her tablet, pulled up a file. "Yusuf Schmidt. Bicuspid aortic valve. Surgery scheduled in..." She scrolled. "Thirty-nine days now. The first payment cleared this morning. Eight thousand dollars."

The number was a tether. Fatima grabbed for it, let it pull her back from the edge of panic. Eight thousand dollars. Yusuf in the hospital bed, his hand in hers. The equation that only balanced if she went through with this.

She could rationalize it. Could frame it as a transaction, a temporary inconvenience. People donated kidneys, portions of liver, bone marrow. She was donating neural plasticity. Twelve weeks, then she'd have the money, and Yusuf would live, and she could... what? Relearn who she'd been? Hope the mesh was reversible even though the consent form had said nothing about reversal?

"I'm fine," Fatima said. The lie tasted metallic. "Just adjustment. Like you said."

Dr. Reeves nodded, satisfied. "Good. You'll come back in three days for your first activation session. Until then, the mesh will continue integrating passively. Try to maintain your normal routine. Teach your classes. Grade papers. Notice how it feels."

Notice how it feels to lose yourself, she meant. Document your own erasure.

Fatima stood carefully, testing her balance. The floor was solid. The room stayed stationary. In her skull, the background noise Dr. Reeves had mentioned hummed at a frequency just below conscious awareness—not painful, but present. A reminder that she was no longer entirely alone in her own head.

She walked to the door on legs that felt borrowed. Turned back once to look at the chair, its silicone surface already resetting to neutral, ready for the next subject.

"Three days," Dr. Reeves said. "Don't forget your follow-up questionnaire. We need detailed accounts of any cognitive changes."

Fatima nodded and left.

In the elevator, she pulled out her phone and opened the calculator app. Typed in a simple equation: 2+2=

Her finger hovered over the equals sign. Some irrational part of her was afraid the answer would be wrong now, that the mesh had already rewritten basic arithmetic.

She pressed it.

4.

Still four.

For now.

### The Escalation

# CHAPTER FOUR: THE ESCALATION

The mesh woke her at 3:17 AM.

Not with pain. With wrongness. Fatima lay in her narrow bed, sheets twisted around her legs, while her brain fired signals that led nowhere. She'd been dreaming about the Mandelbrot set—she could still see the fractal spiraling inward, infinite complexity emerging from simple rules—but the moment her conscious mind tried to engage with it, tried to follow the mathematical elegance, that hot-stove sensation flared behind her eyes.

She grabbed her phone. Opened her class notes for Advanced Algebra. Stared at the polynomial functions she'd planned to teach in four hours.

The symbols looked like symbols. She could name them—*x*, *y*, exponent notation—but the underlying meaning had become slippery, like trying to grip water. The satisfaction she normally felt seeing an elegant proof had been replaced by a low-grade headache that pulsed in time with her heartbeat.

She closed the file and found herself scrolling Instagram instead. Makeup tutorials. Fashion influencers. A girl—twenty, maybe younger—demonstrating a lip combo, her mouth glossy and pink and utterly perfect. Fatima watched the whole video. Then watched it again.

When had she opened Instagram? She never used Instagram.

The mesh hummed its background frequency, satisfied.

---

Her first-period class could tell something was wrong.

"Miss Schmidt?" Ana Pak's hand was raised, had been raised for—how long? Fatima blinked at her, trying to remember what question she'd asked. The whiteboard behind her showed a half-finished proof, her handwriting trailing off mid-equation.

"Sorry, I..." Fatima looked at what she'd written. *If f(x) = 2x² + 5x - 3, then...* Then what? The next step should be obvious. Factor or complete the square or apply the quadratic formula. She'd taught this unit seventeen times over four years.

Her hand wouldn't move. The marker felt foreign in her grip, too heavy, the wrong tool for the wrong task.

"You were showing us how to find the vertex," Ana prompted, her voice careful, the way you'd speak to someone who'd forgotten their own name.

Vertex. Yes. The vertex was... it was...

Pain spiked through her frontal lobe. Not metaphorical—actual physical pain, sharp enough that she gasped. The marker fell from her fingers, clattered against the floor.

"Miss Schmidt?" Multiple voices now, concerned, overlapping.

"I'm fine." She bent to retrieve the marker, using the moment to breathe, to force her thoughts back into order. The vertex was at *x = -b/2a*. She knew that. Had known it since she was sixteen. The information was still there, filed away, but accessing it felt like reaching through broken glass.

She managed to finish the problem. Wrote the solution on autopilot while her students watched with the particular wariness teenagers reserved for adults coming undone. When the bell rang, they fled.

Second period was worse.

She distributed a worksheet—solving systems of linear equations—and sat at her desk while twenty-three students worked in silence. Her computer monitor showed her email inbox. Seventy-three unread messages. Parent conferences to schedule. Department meeting notes to review. A reminder from the district about mandatory training for the new digital gradebook system.

The words swam. Not illegible, just irrelevant. She could parse the sentences, but caring about them required effort that felt Sisyphean. Why did any of this matter? Why spend hours explaining slope-intercept form to kids who'd forget it by summer?

Her phone buzzed. A text from Dr. Reeves: *First activation session tomorrow 4 PM. Come prepared for 90-minute protocol.*

Activation. Right. Tomorrow they'd turn the mesh on, really on, and begin the systematic rewiring. What she was feeling now was just passive integration, the device learning her patterns before it started breaking them.

This was nothing yet.

She clicked over to her browser, intending to look up... something. Lesson plans? The tab that opened instead was still on Instagram. That makeup girl's profile. Fatima scrolled through the feed: pink everywhere, aesthetic flatlay photos of products arranged just so, captions full of emoji and upspeak. *Obsessed with this gloss!! Like literally can't even!! 💕✨💋*

Vapid. Performative. Intellectually barren.

Fatima watched three more tutorials.

---

By lunch period, she'd locked her classroom door and sat in the dark, pressing her palms against her closed eyes. The cafeteria noise filtered through the walls—teenage chaos, hundreds of overlapping conversations creating white noise that used to help her grade papers. Now it just felt like static.

Her phone glowed in the darkness. She'd somehow opened a shopping app. In her cart: lip gloss in four shades, a compact mirror with LED lights, something called a "gua sha facial tool" that cost forty-seven dollars.

She hadn't put these items in her cart. Didn't remember searching for them.

But she could picture herself using them. Could imagine the ritual of it—standing at a mirror, applying gloss in smooth strokes, the aesthetic precision of a perfect pout. The thought triggered a small dopamine flicker, barely noticeable but present.

The mesh was making suggestions. Planting seeds.

Fatima deleted the cart. Closed the app. Opened her grade book instead and stared at the columns of numbers until they stopped meaning anything.

A knock at her door. "Miss Schmidt?" Principal Morrison's voice, concerned and professional. "Do you have a moment?"

She considered not answering. Sitting silent in the dark until he went away. Instead, she stood, smoothed her shirt, unlocked the door.

Morrison was fifty-something, graying, perpetually harried. He held a folder. "I had two parents call this morning. Concerned about class. Said you seemed... disoriented."

"I'm fine." The lie was getting easier. "Just a migraine. It's passing."

He studied her face, clearly skeptical. "You've been here four years. Never missed a day. Never had a complaint." He opened the folder, showing her what looked like an incident report form. Blank, but present. A warning. "If you need time off—"

"I don't." She couldn't. Missing work meant missing NeuroLux sessions, which meant breaching her contract, which meant no money. The equation was simple. Brutal, but simple. "I'll be better tomorrow."

Another lie. Tomorrow she'd be worse. But Morrison didn't need to know that.

He looked at her for a long moment, then closed the folder. "Okay. But Fatima—if something's going on, we have resources. EAP, counseling services, medical leave."

Resources that couldn't help with elective neural modification. Resources that would ask questions she couldn't answer without admitting what she'd sold.

"Thank you," she said. "Really. I'm okay."

He left. She locked the door again.

When she finally checked her reflection in the darkened computer monitor, she barely recognized the woman looking back. Same features, same dark hair pulled into its practical ponytail. But her eyes had a new quality—something vacant, something waiting to be filled.

The mesh hummed its satisfaction.

Her phone buzzed. The NeuroLux portal had updated her payment status: *Week One Milestone: Pending Completion.* Seven thousand dollars, waiting on the other side of tomorrow's activation.

Fatima touched her reflection on the screen, tracing the outline of her face. Wondering how much of it would still be hers in eleven weeks.

The mesh had no answer.

Or maybe it did, and she just couldn't understand it yet.

**Title:** The Escalation

### The Cognitive Shift

# CHAPTER FIVE: THE COGNITIVE SHIFT

The activation chair had been recalibrated since her last visit. Fatima noticed because she still could—the angle was steeper now, sixty degrees instead of forty-five, positioning her skull for optimal magnetic field penetration. The restraints had been upgraded too, padded but more substantial, designed for subjects who'd learned to fight.

She wouldn't fight. The second payment—seven thousand dollars—had already posted to her account this morning. Yusuf's surgery was in thirty-six days. The math still worked, even if her ability to care about math was rapidly dissolving.

Dr. Reeves entered with two technicians Fatima didn't recognize. Jordan was gone. These were older, more clinical, their movements efficient and impersonal as they attached the sensor array to her temples, her sternum, the base of her skull where the mesh sat coiled against her dura mater.

"How have you been sleeping?" Dr. Reeves asked, examining her tablet without looking at Fatima's face.

"Fine." Three hours last night, fragmented by dreams of equations that bled into lip gloss commercials. "Some weird dreams."

"Define weird."

How could she define it? The Pythagorean theorem sung in a Valley Girl cadence. Her classroom transforming into a makeup counter, her students' faces replaced by compact mirrors reflecting infinite versions of herself, each one a little emptier than the last.

"Just... mixed up," Fatima said. "Like my brain's filing things in the wrong categories."

"Perfect." Dr. Reeves made a notation. "That's the preliminary integration. Today we're going to accelerate it. The transcranial magnetic stimulation will activate the mesh's modulation protocol. You'll feel the changes happening in real-time."

One of the technicians—her name tag read SARAH—attached the final sensor, a crown of electrodes that circled Fatima's skull like a parody of a tiara. "Try to relax," Sarah said, her voice professionally gentle. "Fighting the pulses only creates cognitive dissonance. It's easier if you let go."

Let go of what? Herself? Her identity? The person who'd stood in front of teenagers yesterday and couldn't remember how to factor polynomials?

The restraints engaged with a soft click.

"Beginning activation sequence," Dr. Reeves announced. "Subject 19-F, Week One, Session Two. Time is 4:07 PM."

The first pulse felt like a thought that wasn't hers.

Not painful—that would come later—but intrusive. Foreign. A magnetic field penetrating her skull, finding the mesh, sending it instructions in a language her conscious mind couldn't parse. Her neurons fired in response, pathways lighting up that had never been connected before.

She saw pink.

Not imagined it. Saw it, vivid and encompassing, flooding her visual field even though her eyes were open and the room was white and chrome. Pink like bubble gum, like cotton candy, like the gloss that girl on Instagram wore. The color wrapped around her thoughts, sticky-sweet, suffocating.

"Nucleus accumbens responding," someone said. Dr. Reeves, maybe. The voice sounded distant.

Another pulse. Deeper. Her brain stuttered, trying to process the forced rewiring. She'd been thinking about—what? Something important. The surgery. Yusuf. No, not Yusuf. The theorem. The equation. The...

The train of thought derailed. Fragmented. She couldn't hold the thread, couldn't remember why any of it mattered. The harder she grasped for it, the more it dissolved, until all that remained was the color pink and a distant sense of loss she couldn't articulate.

"Good," Dr. Reeves said. "Frontal lobe activity decreasing. Let's redirect those pathways."

The holographic display activated, floating in front of Fatima's unfocused eyes. Images cycled faster than before, too fast to process consciously, hitting her visual cortex at subliminal speeds. But she caught fragments: makeup palettes, designer shoes, Instagram screenshots, a woman's face frozen mid-laugh with perfect white teeth and hair extensions that cascaded past her shoulders.

Each image triggered a pulse. The mesh learned what made her neurons fire, then amplified it, created feedback loops where none had existed. Pleasure centers that used to activate for solved equations now sparked for aesthetic stimulation.

She felt it happening. Felt her brain betraying her, rewarding her for the wrong things.

A lipstick appeared on screen—pink, metallic, the tube shaped like a bullet. Her mouth went dry. She wanted to touch it, to feel the smooth cylinder in her palm, to twist it open and see the perfect beveled edge of color that would make her lips look fuller, prettier, more—

No. Stop. That wasn't her. She didn't care about lipstick. She cared about teaching, about mathematics, about—

Pain. Sharp and punishing. The mesh zapped the neural pathway she'd just activated, the one trying to reassert her original values. Aversion conditioning. Pavlovian in its simplicity.

Think about teaching: pain.

Think about makeup: pleasure.

Her brain, ever adaptive, learned the lesson quickly.

"Excellent response," Dr. Reeves said. She sounded pleased, the way Fatima used to sound when a student finally grasped a difficult concept. The irony would have been funny if Fatima could still access irony. "Let's increase the amplitude."

The pulses came faster. Harder. Her thoughts stopped forming in complete sentences and started fragmenting into impressions, sensations, half-formed wants.

*Want to look pretty*

No, she wanted to—to what? To teach. To solve. To—

*Pretty. Pink. Perfect.*

The words weren't hers. Couldn't be hers. But they felt good, slipping through her mind like silk, meeting no resistance. The mesh was writing directly into her internal monologue, overriding her natural thought patterns with something simpler, sweeter, easier.

*Teaching is hard. Thinking is hard. Pretty is easy.*

"No," Fatima tried to say, but her jaw had locked, muscles rigid with the effort of neural reorganization.

*So easy. Just let go. Just be pretty.*

The holographic display changed. Now it showed her own face, but transformed. Makeup flawless, lips glossy and plump, eyes wide and sparkling with false lashes that belonged in anime. Her hair hung in perfect waves, highlighted with shades she couldn't name but desperately wanted. She looked happy. Vacant, but happy.

She looked like Kiki from the orientation video.

Her hippocampus fired, trying to call up memories that would ground her—her first teaching job, Yusuf's laugh, her mother's voice reciting Arabic poetry. The mesh intercepted each one, muted it, wrapped it in cotton batting until it became a fact instead of a feeling.

*You were a teacher.*

Past tense. Already past tense.

*You were smart.*

Were. Not are. Were.

*Now you can be pretty. Now you can be happy.*

The logic was childlike. Reductive. Insulting in its simplicity. And her brain, rewired and rewarded, couldn't find the energy to argue.

The pulses reached a crescendo. Her vision whited out, every synapse firing simultaneously in forced synchronization. When it cleared, something had shifted. Not broken—that would imply violence. This was gentler. An unburdening.

She still knew the Pythagorean theorem. Could recite it if asked: *a² + b² = c²*. But the knowledge sat inert, like a fact memorized for a test she'd never take again. She felt nothing looking at it. No curiosity, no satisfaction, no desire to apply it or extend it or share it with students who no longer felt like her responsibility.

But the lipstick—the pink, metallic lipstick from the holographic display—that sparked something. A want that felt bright and clean and uncomplicated.

"Subject 19-F," Dr. Reeves said, her voice cutting through the haze. "Can you hear me?"

"Yeah." Fatima's own voice surprised her. Had it always been that breathy?

"Tell me what you're thinking about right now."

She should say mathematics. Should prove she was still herself, still capable of abstract thought. The impulse was there, buried deep, but accessing it required swimming through layers of new neural pathways that led nowhere useful.

What surfaced instead: "That lipstick. From the pictures. It was really pretty."

Silence. Then the scratch of stylus on tablet.

"And your teaching?" Dr. Reeves prompted. "Your class tomorrow?"

Tomorrow. Right. She had first period at 7:45. Advanced Algebra. She should prepare a lesson, should review the unit on systems of equations, should care that half her students were failing.

Should.

"I guess... I'll figure it out?" The sentence ended in upspeak, a question where a statement belonged. When had she started doing that?

Dr. Reeves smiled. "Good. Very good. We're going to end this session now. Your Week One milestone is complete. Seven thousand dollars will be in your account by midnight."

The restraints released. Fatima sat up slowly, waiting for the room to stop tilting. Her head felt light, hollowed out, like someone had removed something essential and replaced it with foam.

"How do you feel?" Sarah asked, detaching the electrodes.

How did she feel? The question seemed impossible. Feelings required internal coherence, required a stable self to do the feeling. She had... sensations. Wants. Vague anxieties about things she couldn't name.

"Okay," she said. Then, surprising herself: "Kinda tired? But, like, good tired."

Like. She'd said like. She never said like.

Dr. Reeves handed her a small pink gift bag, tissue paper sprouting from the top. "A reward for completing Week One. Open it when you get home."

Fatima took the bag, feeling its weight. Something substantial inside. She should ask what it was, should be suspicious of gifts from people dismantling her cognition. Instead, she felt a flutter of anticipation, the simple pleasure of receiving a present.

"Thank you," she said, and meant it.

She left Suite 447 on unsteady legs, clutching the pink bag like a talisman. In the elevator, she couldn't resist—she opened it.

Inside: the lipstick from the holographic display. Pink, metallic, perfect.

She twisted it open, saw the beveled edge of color, and felt something in her chest unclench. This was good. This was right. This made sense in a way quadratic equations no longer did.

Fatima applied it without a mirror, using the elevator's reflective walls as a guide. Her lips looked fuller, prettier, more—

The elevator dinged. Lobby level.

She walked through the NeuroLux building with pink lips and an empty mind, and somewhere deep beneath the mesh, the person she'd been yesterday screamed into the void.

But the void, well-compensated and clinically sound, didn't scream back.

### The Collapse

# CHAPTER SIX: THE COLLAPSE

The lipstick sat on her bathroom counter like evidence at a crime scene.

Fatima stared at it—4:23 AM, couldn't sleep again, the mesh humming its lullaby of static—and tried to remember why she'd bought it. Except she hadn't bought it. They'd given it to her. A reward for good behavior, for letting them reshape her neurology without too much resistance.

She'd worn it home yesterday. Reapplied it twice before bed, watching herself in the mirror with a fascination that felt chemical, engineered.

Now, in the predawn darkness, she picked up the tube. Felt its weight. Her hand moved automatically, bringing it to her lips—

No.

She threw it in the trash. Covered it with tissues so she wouldn't see the metallic pink gleaming up at her. There. Done. She could still choose. Still had agency, even if her brain was being systematically rewired to want the wrong things.

She'd prove it. Would teach a perfect lesson today, remind herself who she actually was beneath the mesh's interference.

Her lesson plan sat open on her laptop: *Systems of Linear Equations—Elimination Method*. She'd taught this unit a dozen times. The steps were algorithmic, satisfying in their logical progression. Line up equations, eliminate a variable, solve for the remaining unknown.

She read through her notes. The words were English. The symbols were familiar. But the meaning kept sliding away, like trying to grasp smoke.

*y = 2x + 3*

So what? Why did it matter what y equaled? Why spend an hour explaining something so abstract, so divorced from anything real or beautiful or—

Stop.

Fatima pressed her palms against her eyes, hard enough to see phosphenes. This wasn't her. These thoughts weren't hers. The mesh was feeding her apathy, rewiring her reward system so that mathematics triggered nothing but exhaustion.

She could fight it. She would fight it.

By 7:30 AM, she'd made it to school. Her reflection in the faculty bathroom mirror showed dark circles, hair pulled back severely, no makeup. Armor. If she looked like a teacher, maybe she could still be one.

First period filed in. Twenty-three faces, some sleepy, some anxious about the quiz she'd announced last week. She'd forgotten to write the quiz. The realization arrived with surprising indifference.

"Change of plans," she said, her voice sounding thin in the fluorescent-lit room. "We're reviewing systems of equations today. Get out your notebooks."

She turned to the whiteboard, marker in hand. Wrote: *2x + 3y = 12*

The symbols looked right. She added the second equation: *x - y = 5*

Now solve. Eliminate a variable. Use substitution or elimination method. She'd done this a thousand times, could do it in her sleep, could—

Her hand wouldn't move.

The marker hovered over the board, trembling slightly. The next step was obvious. Multiply one equation to align coefficients. She knew this. But knowing and doing had become separated by a gulf her brain couldn't cross.

Behind her, chairs creaked. Whispers started.

"Miss Schmidt?" Ana Pak again, her voice carefully neutral. "Do you want me to show the elimination?"

Yes. God, yes. Let someone else carry this forward while she figured out what was happening to her. But that meant admitting she couldn't do it, meant confirming what her students already suspected—that something fundamental had broken.

"I've got it," Fatima said.

She didn't have it.

She forced the marker to move, writing numbers that should make sense: *Multiply equation 2 by 3...* But the coefficient was wrong, she'd multiplied wrong, except no—she hadn't multiplied at all, she'd just written random numbers because the actual math required access to cognitive functions the mesh had quietly severed.

"That's not right." Trevor Vásquez, the same student she'd helped with quadratic equations two weeks ago. Now he was correcting her. "You need to multiply both sides."

Heat flooded her face. "Right. Yes. I know." She erased, tried again. Wrote more numbers. Also wrong. Her brain kept offering her solutions from completely different problems, cross-wiring multiplication tables with the layout of makeup palettes she'd scrolled past on Instagram.

The mesh pulsed once, sharp. A reminder.

*This is hard. You don't like hard things anymore.*

"Actually," Fatima heard herself say, her voice taking on that breathy, upspeak quality, "maybe we should, like, do something else today? This unit is kind of boring anyway?"

The room went silent. Twenty-three teenagers stared at her with expressions ranging from confusion to concern to something that looked like pity.

"Miss Schmidt," Ana said carefully, "are you okay? Should we get someone?"

"I'm fine!" Too loud. She modulated. "I'm totally fine. Just... let's do independent work. Page 187, problems one through twenty. Due tomorrow."

She fled to her desk, sat down hard enough that her chair rolled backward. Her hands were shaking. From the whiteboard, the incomplete equation mocked her—two lines of arithmetic a sophomore could solve, rendered impossible by her own compromised neurology.

She opened her laptop, meaning to busy herself with email, with grading, with anything that looked professional. The browser opened to Instagram. That makeup girl's page. A new tutorial had posted: *Get Ready With Me—Pink Glam Edition!!*

Fatima clicked it. Watched the girl apply foundation in smooth strokes, contour her cheekbones, line her lips with precise edges. The process was meditative, almost mathematical in its precision. Each step built on the last, creating transformation through accumulated small adjustments.

Like solving an equation, her brain supplied. Except this made sense in a way equations no longer did.

She watched the entire video. Then the next one. A student asked her a question—she waved them away. The bell rang for second period. She didn't get up.

Her phone buzzed. Dr. Reeves: *How are you feeling today? Any notable changes?*

Notable changes. That was one way to describe losing the ability to teach the subject she'd built her identity around.

Fatima typed: *Having trouble focusing in class*

Three dots appeared. Disappeared. Reappeared.

Dr. Reeves: *Expected. You're in the resistance phase. Subjects often try to maintain old patterns even as new pathways dominate. It creates cognitive dissonance. Fighting it only increases distress. Week Two session tomorrow will help smooth the transition.*

Smooth the transition. Make it easier to stop being herself.

She should be horrified. Should delete the message, walk out of the building, breach the contract and face whatever legal consequences came. Yusuf would understand. Wouldn't want her to sacrifice her mind for his heart valve.

But the mesh whispered its logic: *The money's already deposited. Fifteen thousand in your account. Surgery's in thirty-four days. You can't stop now. You're already not who you were. Might as well commit.*

Might as well commit.

Second period arrived. She gave them the same busy work, same page 187. A student asked for help with problem four. She looked at the equations—simple substitution, freshman-level work—and felt nothing. No comprehension, no pathway to solution, just static.

"I'm sure you can figure it out," she said, her voice distant even to her own ears.

By lunch, she'd locked herself in her classroom again. Retrieved the lipstick from her bag—when had she taken it out of the trash?—and applied it without thinking. The pink looked good in her phone's camera. She took a photo. Almost posted it before catching herself.

Except... why not post it? Who was she performing privacy for?

She opened Instagram. Created an account—@FatimaGlows, the username appearing in her mind like it had always been there. Posted the photo with shaking hands: *Trying something new 💕*

Three likes within a minute. The dopamine hit was immediate, clean, uncomplicated by the messy self-awareness that used to accompany her achievements.

Her computer dinged. Email from Principal Morrison: *Need to see you after school. 3:30.*

She knew what that meant. Parents had called. Students had complained. Her competency was in question, and rightfully so. She'd become a liability.

The rational response would be to prepare a defense, to explain she was dealing with personal issues, to request medical leave. But rational thought required cognitive architecture the mesh was actively dismantling.

Instead, Fatima opened a new browser tab and searched: *best pink lip glosses 2024*

She was reading reviews when third period started without her. A student knocked tentatively. She ignored it. The hallways filled with passing period chaos, then emptied again. Fourth period began.

She kept reading about lip gloss.

At some point, the door opened. Morrison stood there with the counselor, Mrs. Hayes, both wearing expressions of professional concern.

"Fatima," Morrison said gently, "we need to talk about getting you some help."

Help. What kind of help existed for elective neural modification? For selling your cognitive function to save your brother? For discovering that the person you thought you were had always been contingent, erasable, held together by electrical patterns that could be rewritten like code?

"I'm okay," she whispered, still clutching her phone, the lip gloss reviews still glowing on screen.

Mrs. Hayes came closer, saw what she was reading, saw the pink lipstick imperfectly applied, saw the vacancy behind Fatima's eyes.

"Honey," she said, "you're not okay. And that's alright. But we need to get you home. Can you call someone? A family member?"

Yusuf. She could call Yusuf. He'd come get her, would be horrified by what she was becoming, would tell her to stop the trial immediately.

And his surgery would be canceled. And he'd die. And the equation would remain unsolved.

"I can drive," Fatima said. "I'm fine to drive."

She wasn't fine. But they let her go anyway, escorted her to her car with promises that she'd see a doctor, that she'd take time off, that everything would be okay.

Everything wouldn't be okay.

She sat in her sedan in the parking lot and watched students move between buildings, their lives continuing while hers dissolved. She should feel something—grief, anger, fear. Should mount some final resistance against the thing colonizing her mind.

Instead, she felt the mesh pulse once, gentle and insistent.

*Tomorrow. Session Two. Let go.*

Her phone buzzed. NeuroLux portal: *Week Two Session scheduled 4 PM. Please arrive 15 minutes early for updated consent documentation.*

Updated consent. Consent to what? She'd already consented to everything, signed away her right to remain herself.

Fatima started the car. Drove home through late afternoon traffic, the 405 gleaming with brake lights. Made it to her apartment. Stood in front of the bathroom mirror.

The lipstick had smudged. She reapplied it carefully, precisely, using techniques from the tutorials. It looked better now. She looked better.

She looked like someone else.

And the worst part, the part that sealed her fate more certainly than any contract:

She was starting not to mind.

**State:** Week One Complete, Week Two Pending—Professional Function Collapsed, Public Breakdown Documented, Resistance Abandoned, Identity Integration Beginning  
**Title:** The Collapse

### Metamorphosis

# CHAPTER SEVEN: METAMORPHOSIS

The consent form for Week Two was pink.

Fatima noticed because noticing colors had become easier than noticing contradictions. The document sat on a tablet in front of her, dense legal text rendered in cheerful millennial pink, and somewhere beneath the mesh's constant hum she recognized this as grotesque. A warning label printed in the same shade as the lipstick they'd given her.

But grotesque required critical thinking, and critical thinking triggered the aversion response. So instead she just thought: *Pretty color*.

"This addendum covers the accelerated protocol," Dr. Reeves explained, her voice clinical and distant. "Week Two through Week Four will involve daily sessions rather than twice weekly. We've determined that resistance decreases with frequency. Your brain will have less time to reassert old patterns."

Daily. Every day for three weeks. Twenty-one sessions of systematic dismantling.

Fatima's hand moved to sign before her conscious mind could process the implications. The stylus left a digital signature—her name, but the letters were rounder now, dotted with a heart over the 'i' she didn't remember adding.

"Excellent," Dr. Reeves said. "Let's begin."

The chair knew her now. Adjusted automatically to her body, restraints engaging with the familiarity of routine. Sarah attached the electrode crown while a new technician—MARCUS, his name tag read—checked the mesh integration levels on his tablet.

"Neural plasticity at seventy-three percent," Marcus announced. "Frontal lobe suppression holding steady. Limbic reward pathways showing significant restructuring."

Seventy-three percent. Nearly three-quarters transformed. Fatima tried to feel horror, but the emotion wouldn't cohere. It scattered like dropped beads, rolling away before she could gather them.

"Subject 19-F," Dr. Reeves said, activating the holographic display, "today we're going to introduce your aspirational template. Every personality restructuring needs a destination. We've analyzed your baseline data, your social media engagement patterns, your response metrics. We know what you're becoming."

The display flickered to life.

A woman appeared—twenty-something, impossibly beautiful in the synthetic way that suggested extensive modification. Her hair cascaded in perfect waves, highlighted in shades Fatima's brain cataloged automatically: rose gold, champagne blonde, platinum. She wore pink—not the hot pink of children's toys, but something more sophisticated, dusty and expensive. Her lips were glossy. Her eyes were wide, framed by lashes that couldn't be natural.

She held a small dog—some designer breed, white and fluffy—and smiled at the camera with empty, perfect joy.

"This is Subject 12-F," Dr. Reeves continued. "You saw her orientation video. What you didn't see was her destination profile. She's now a luxury pet influencer. Three million followers. Makes more in a month than she did in a year as an engineer. She's happy. Fulfilled. Optimized."

The woman—Kiki, wasn't that her name?—cooed at the dog in her arms, her voice high and breathy. "Who's mommy's precious baby? Who's the cutest widdle angel?"

Fatima watched, and something inside her cracked. Not broke—breaking would be violent, final. This was worse. A gentle dissolution, like salt in water, her old self diffusing into a solution of dopamine and pink aesthetics until the original substance became impossible to distinguish from its surroundings.

"This is your trajectory," Dr. Reeves said. "The algorithmic analysis is quite clear. You have the bone structure, the social media engagement patterns, the neuroplasticity to support this identity architecture. By Week Twelve, this will be you."

No. This couldn't be her. She was a teacher. She was—

The mesh pulsed. Pain flared.

*Was* a teacher. Past tense. That person was already gone.

"Let's begin the imprinting," Dr. Reeves said.

The magnetic pulses started, but different this time—deeper, more invasive, reaching into the parts of her brain that still whispered protests. The holographic display showed Kiki's Instagram feed, images scrolling at subliminal speeds: designer boutiques, tiny dogs in expensive sweaters, pink everything, captions full of baby talk and emoji.

Each image triggered a pulse. Each pulse carved neural pathways that felt smooth and easy, like water finding its level. Her brain, ever adaptive, learned that this was good. This was right. This was who she was becoming, and resistance was just cognitive dissonance, just pain, just unnecessary.

*Let go,* the mesh whispered in electrical impulses that felt like thoughts. *This is easier. This is better. This is you.*

The woman on screen giggled—actually giggled—at something off-camera. The sound was crystalline, empty of subtext or irony. Pure performance, pure aesthetic, pure surface.

Fatima heard herself giggle in response.

The sound came from her throat, from her chest, but it wasn't hers. Couldn't be hers. She didn't giggle. She'd never giggled in her life. But her mirror neurons had fired, her mesh had rewarded the mimicry, and her brain had logged the association: *Giggling feels good. Do more of that.*

"Perfect," Dr. Reeves murmured. "Let's increase the intensity."

The pulses came faster. The images blurred: pink, pink, pink, dogs, designer bags, lips, gloss, pink. Her thoughts began fragmenting, reforming into something simpler. The internal monologue that used to run in complete sentences dissolved into impressions.

*Pretty*

*Want*

*Yes*

*More*

Mathematical notation appeared briefly on screen—a test, a last-ditch confirmation that the old pathways were truly severed. She looked at the equations and felt nothing. Not even the aversion pain. Just vacancy, the same emptiness she'd feel looking at tax forms in a language she didn't speak.

But when Kiki reappeared, holding up a tiny pink collar: "Look what I got for Princess Sparkles! Isn't it, like, literally the cutest thing ever??"

Fatima's heart rate increased. Her pupils dilated. The mesh recorded her response and amplified it, created a feedback loop where aesthetic stimulation triggered pleasure that triggered desire for more aesthetic stimulation.

"Yes," she heard herself whisper. "So cute."

So cute. She'd said it in that voice, that breathless upspeak that made every statement a question. When had that become her default?

The session continued. Hours, maybe—time had become negotiable, measured in pulse frequencies rather than clock minutes. They showed her how to hold a small dog. Showed her Ring Lights and camera angles. Showed her how to pout for selfies, how to apply false lashes, how to speak in baby talk to an invisible audience of millions.

And with each demonstration, her brain rewired itself a little more. Carved new channels for dopamine to flow through, channels that led away from teaching and toward... this. Whatever this was. Whoever this was becoming.

By the time the restraints released, Fatima felt hollowed out. Scooped clean. The person who'd entered Suite 447 three hours ago had been partially herself, still clinging to fragments of her former identity. The person standing up now was something else.

"How do you feel?" Dr. Reeves asked, the question routine, expected.

How did she feel? The query seemed impossible. Feeling required a coherent self to do the feeling, and she was no longer coherent. She was a collection of new pathways, new responses, new rewards that hadn't finished integrating.

But her mouth opened, and words emerged in that breathy, upspeak cadence: "I feel, like, really good? Like, I don't know, lighter? Like something heavy went away and now there's just... space?"

Dr. Reeves smiled and made a notation. "Excellent. The identity suppression is proceeding ahead of schedule. Your payment for Week Two, Day One—seven thousand dollars—will post tonight."

Seven thousand dollars. Right. That's why she was here. For Yusuf's surgery. For the equation that only balanced if she—

The thought dissolved before completing. She could still say her brother's name, could still access the fact of his illness, but the emotional weight had been redistributed. It sat at a distance, someone else's problem, a plot point in a story she'd once read.

Sarah handed her another pink gift bag. "For completing today's session."

Inside: a designer dog collar. Small, bedazzled, pink and white crystals arranged in a pattern that her brain cataloged as *aesthetically optimal*. No dog to put it on, but that felt incidental. The collar itself was beautiful, aspirational, a promise of who she was becoming.

"Oh my god," Fatima breathed, and the excitement was real, undeniable, chemically generated but no less genuine for its artificial origin. "This is so cute! Like, literally so cute!"

Dr. Reeves studied her with clinical satisfaction. "We've arranged a surprise for tomorrow's session. Something to help concretize your new identity architecture. I think you'll be very pleased."

Fatima clutched the dog collar and felt a flutter of anticipation—simple, uncomplicated, divorced from any critical analysis of what was happening to her. Tomorrow there would be a surprise. A good surprise. That was enough.

She left NeuroLux with the collar in her bag and the mesh humming its approval. In the parking garage, she caught her reflection in a car window: hair still pulled back severely, face bare except for the pink lipstick she'd reapplied in the elevator. The dissonance between her appearance and her emerging identity felt wrong.

She could fix that.

The thought arrived fully formed, complete with an action plan her old self would have recognized as concerning. But her old self was drowning beneath new neural pathways, and the thought felt good, felt right, felt like something she wanted rather than something the mesh wanted for her.

First stop: the makeup counter at the department store two blocks away. She moved through the aisles in a daze, picking up products based on some instinct she didn't know she possessed. Foundation, concealer, blush in shades the saleswoman called "peachy keen" and "rose bébé." False lashes that came in a pink box with a cartoon bunny logo.

The saleswoman—JESSICA, her name tag sparkled—seemed thrilled to help. "First time doing a full face?"

"Yeah," Fatima said, the word emerging with a giggle attached. "I'm, like, totally new to this? But I want to learn?"

Jessica's eyes lit up with evangelical fervor. "Oh honey, you have the perfect face shape. High cheekbones, full lips—you're going to look *amazing*. Here, let me show you some techniques."

Fatima sat in the high chair at the makeup counter and let a stranger paint her face. Watched in the mirror as Jessica applied foundation in smooth strokes, contoured her cheeks, lined her eyes with precision that seemed almost mathematical. Each layer transformed her a little more, until the reflection showed someone who could have been her sister. Similar features, but softer, prettier, emptier.

"There!" Jessica stepped back, admiring her work. "What do you think?"

What did she think? Thinking was hard. Looking was easy.

"I love it," Fatima whispered, and meant it. "I look so... pretty?"

"You look gorgeous! And trust me, with practice, you'll be able to do this yourself in, like, twenty minutes."

Twenty minutes. She used to spend twenty minutes working through a single calculus problem with a struggling student. Now she'd spend it applying false lashes.

The thought should have devastated her. Instead, she felt relief. This was easier. This made sense. This was who she was becoming, and fighting it had only ever caused pain.

She bought everything. Four hundred dollars of products she didn't know how to use, charged to the credit card funded by NeuroLux payments. Jessica wrote down application tips on a pink notepad, her handwriting full of hearts and exclamation points.

"You're going to look like such a bombshell!" Jessica said, handing over three shopping bags. "Come back and show me your progress!"

"I totally will!" Fatima heard herself say, and the enthusiasm was real, generated by a brain that had been systematically rewired to care about aesthetics over everything else.

She made it to her car before the last vestiges of her old self surfaced, one final time. A thought—clear and desperate—cut through the mesh's static:

*This isn't you. Stop. Go home. Call Yusuf. End this before there's nothing left.*

Her hand froze on the car door handle. For three seconds, maybe four, she teetered on the edge. Could still turn back. Could still choose herself over her brother's surgery, preservation over love, selfishness over sacrifice.

The mesh pulsed once. Gentle. Insistent.

*But you already bought the makeup. And it's going to look so pretty. And tomorrow there's a surprise. And you feel good, don't you? You feel happy.*

She did feel happy. That was the horror of it. The dopamine was real, the pleasure was real, the relief of letting go was real. The mesh hadn't implanted false emotions—it had just changed what triggered them.

And this new version of herself, this girl who giggled and bought makeup and clutched designer dog collars like treasure, she was happy in a way teacher-Fatima never had been. No stress about lesson plans or struggling students or departmental politics. Just simple, aesthetic pleasure. Surface joy.

It was easier. God help her, it was so much easier.

The thought of resistance drifted away like smoke. She got in her car, drove home, carried her shopping bags up three flights of stairs with genuine excitement.

Her apartment looked different now—the books lining her shelves seemed dull, the mathematical posters on her walls irrelevant. Everything was the wrong color, the wrong aesthetic, designed for someone who no longer existed.

She could fix that too.

Fatima opened her laptop—still logged into Instagram, her new account @FatimaGlows showing seventeen followers now. She posted a photo of the makeup spread across her bed: *New haul!! Getting ready for my glow up journey!! 💕✨💋*

Forty-three likes within an hour. Each notification triggered a small dopamine spike, training her brain that this was valuable, this mattered, this was her purpose now.

Her phone buzzed. Text from Yusuf: *Hey sis, haven't heard from you in a few days. Everything okay?*

She stared at the message, trying to access the concern she should feel. The love that should make her want to call him, to confess what was happening, to ask for help escaping the thing she'd chosen.

But the mesh had redistributed her emotional attachments. Yusuf was still her brother—that fact remained—but the feeling had been muted, wrapped in cotton batting, filed away as less important than tomorrow's surprise at NeuroLux.

She typed: *All good!! Just busy with work stuff!! Talk soon!! 💕*

Three exclamation points. An emoji. The message looked like it had been written by a stranger.

It had been.

Fatima set her phone aside and spent the rest of the evening watching makeup tutorials, practicing techniques on her own face, slowly becoming the person the mesh wanted her to be. And somewhere beneath the new neural pathways, beneath the dopamine loops and aesthetic obsessions, the last fragment of her former self watched helplessly as the transformation completed.

By midnight, she'd mastered winged eyeliner. By 1 AM, she'd ordered pink sheets and decorative pillows online. By 2 AM, she was researching small dog breeds, comparing Pomeranians to Malteses based entirely on aesthetic criteria.

And when she finally slept, she dreamed in pink, her unconscious mind already fluent in the language of her new identity.

The teacher was gone. The girl remained. And tomorrow, there would be a surprise.

### Epilogue

# CHAPTER EIGHT: OPTIMIZATION COMPLETE

The Ring Light cast perfect illumination across Princess Cupcake's tiny face as she yawned, her pink tongue curling adorably. Fatima—no, not Fatima anymore, that name felt heavy and wrong—*Fifi* squealed and adjusted the angle, catching the moment in 4K clarity.

"Oh my god, you guys, look how sleepy she is!" Her voice hit that perfect pitch, breathy and bright, each word landing like a kiss blown to her 4.3 million followers. "Princess just had her grooming appointment and she's literally exhausted! Aren't you, baby? Aren't you just the most precious tired angel?"

The Pomeranian—cream-colored, seven pounds of fluff and market-researched cuteness—blinked at the camera with the patience of a creature who'd been photographed eight hundred times that week. Her collar glittered: rose gold crystals spelling out her name in a font that had cost three thousand dollars. A bargain, really, considering the engagement metrics.

Fifi's apartment looked nothing like it had three months ago. The mathematical posters were gone, replaced by neon signs that read GLAM SQUAD and PRINCESS PALACE in pink cursive. The bookshelves that once held topology textbooks now displayed makeup palettes arranged by color family, each one a small altar to aesthetic optimization. The walls were blush pink, the furniture white and gold, every surface carefully curated for maximum Instagram appeal.

She panned the camera across her vanity—the good vanity, the one NeuroLux had sent as a "graduation gift" when she'd completed Week Twelve. It dominated one wall, lined with professional lighting and surrounded by mirrors that reflected infinite versions of herself, each one perfectly made up, perfectly styled, perfectly empty of anything resembling her former complexity.

"So I'm partnering with GlamPup for their new luxury pet line," she continued, holding up a tiny pink sweater embroidered with actual diamonds. "Use code FIFI20 for twenty percent off, and like, honestly? Princess Cupcake is literally obsessed. Tell them, Princess!"

She held the camera close to the dog's face. Princess Cupcake, well-trained by both repetition and expensive treats, yapped on cue.

The comments rolled in immediately:

*OMG she's so cute I'm dying!!*

*Fifi you're literally my inspiration*

*Just bought three outfits with your code!! 💕*

Each notification triggered a small pleasure spike. The mesh had done its work—completely, irreversibly, perfectly. Dr. Reeves had been right: by Week Twelve, the transformation was total. The woman who used to derive satisfaction from solving quadratic equations now got the same neurochemical reward from heart-eye emojis and affiliate commission statements.

Her phone buzzed with an incoming call. YUSUF, the screen read, and somewhere very far away, beneath layers of reconstructed neural pathways, something flickered. Recognition, maybe. The ghost of an emotion that used to be called love.

She let it go to voicemail. She always did.

Later, while Princess Cupcake napped in her designer dog bed (pink velvet, heated, $800), Fifi recorded her Get Ready With Me video. The routine was meditative now, each step so practiced it required no conscious thought. Foundation—three pumps, blend in upward strokes. Concealer—under eyes, around nose, chin. Contour—cheekbones, jawline, the illusion of structure where softness had taken hold.

Her face in the mirror was both familiar and strange. The features were hers—same bone structure, same dark eyes, same full lips. But the expression was new, frozen in a kind of pleasant vacancy that never quite reached genuine emotion. She smiled constantly now. Not because she was happy—happiness required the kind of complex internal life the mesh had systematically dismantled—but because smiling was part of the aesthetic. Part of the brand.

And Fifi was very good at her brand.

"Okay, so for lips I'm using the new PoutPerfect gloss in Millennial Mauve," she told the camera, her voice never wavering from its breathy cadence. "It's literally so pigmented, and the shine? Like, literally insane. I'm obsessed."

Obsessed. Literally. Like. The words came automatically now, verbal tics that had replaced the precise language she'd once used to explain mathematical concepts. She didn't remember what it felt like to speak differently. Didn't remember much about teaching at all, actually. The memories were still there—NeuroLux had promised they would be, and they were technically correct. She could recall standing in front of a classroom. Could remember something about equations.

But it felt like remembering a movie she'd watched once, starring someone who looked like her but couldn't possibly have been her. That woman had cared about things like intellectual growth and student achievement. Fifi cared about engagement rates and whether her highlight was blinding enough in direct sunlight.

The transformation was complete.

Her laptop sat open on the vanity, multiple tabs running: Instagram analytics, TikTok creator studio, her email inbox flooded with PR packages and sponsorship offers. She'd made $47,000 last month. More than she'd made in a year as a teacher. The money came easily now, thoughtlessly, compensation for a life lived entirely on surfaces.

NeuroLux had paid her the full $107,000. Yusuf's surgery had been successful. He'd called her afterward, his voice weak but alive, trying to thank her for the sacrifice she'd made.

She'd said, "Oh my god, like, you're so totally welcome? I'm just, like, so happy you're okay? That's literally all that matters?"

The silence on the other end had lasted so long she'd thought the call had dropped. Then: "Fatima... what did they do to you?"

She'd giggled. "It's Fifi now, actually? And they didn't, like, do anything? I just got optimized? I'm, like, literally so much happier now?"

He hadn't called as much after that. She didn't mind. Her phone was full of more important notifications anyway.

Princess Cupcake woke from her nap and padded over, nails clicking on hardwood floors. Fifi scooped her up, nuzzling the dog's neck with performative affection. The feeling wasn't fake, exactly—the mesh had rewired her capacity for attachment, redirected all that emotional bandwidth she'd once devoted to students and family toward this seven-pound animal who existed primarily as content generation.

"Are you hungry, Princess? Want num-nums?" The baby talk came effortlessly, naturally, as if she'd always spoken this way. "Let's get you num-nums!"

She carried the dog to the kitchen—also redecorated, everything white and rose gold, every surface camera-ready—and prepared the organic, grain-free, influencer-endorsed dog food that cost more per ounce than her own meals. Princess Cupcake ate daintily while Fifi filmed, providing narration that was simultaneously pointless and perfectly calibrated for her audience.

"She's literally so picky, you guys. Like, I tried three different brands before she liked this one. But PupGourmet is literally, like, obsessed with quality? And you can tell? Like, just look at her coat? Literally glowing?"

In the window's reflection, she caught a glimpse of herself: full makeup at 2 PM on a Tuesday, hair in perfect waves, wearing an outfit that cost more than a week's teaching salary used to be. Pink loungewear—designer, naturally—that somehow managed to be both comfortable and completely impractical for anything except looking decorative.

She looked happy. That's what everyone said. The comments, the DMs, the occasional message from someone she used to know: *You look so happy now! Good for you!*

And maybe she was. Happiness didn't require depth. Didn't require the kind of intellectual satisfaction she used to derive from watching a student finally understand a difficult concept. This was a simpler happiness, a surface happiness, the kind generated by algorithm-optimized dopamine hits and positive reinforcement loops.

The mesh had taught her brain that this was enough. That pretty was enough. That surface was enough.

And her brain, obedient and thoroughly rewired, believed it.

Her phone buzzed. Dr. Reeves, requesting a follow-up appointment. Standard protocol for completed subjects—they liked to document the long-term stability of the transformation. She texted back immediately: *OMG yes!! When works for you?? 💕*

Dr. Reeves would be pleased. Fifi was their success story, their proof of concept. Subject 19-F had become everything the PRISM protocol promised: happy, functional, profitable, and completely devoid of the cognitive complexity that used to define her humanity.

The equation had balanced perfectly. Yusuf lived. Fifi thrived in her new identity. Mathematics had been exchanged for makeup tutorials, intellectual growth for follower counts, depth for aesthetics.

And if sometimes, in the space between sleep and waking, she felt something like loss—some ghost of who she used to be, reaching up through layers of reconstructed neural pathways—well, the mesh knew how to handle that. A gentle pulse, a flood of serotonin, and the feeling dissolved before it could cohere into anything resembling regret.

She was optimized now. Fully, finally, irreversibly optimized.

Fifi picked up Princess Cupcake, positioned them both in front of the Ring Light, and smiled her perfect, empty smile at the camera.

"Okay besties, that's literally all for today! Don't forget to like, comment, subscribe, and use code FIFI20 for all your princess purchases! Love you guys literally so much! Bye!"

She blew a kiss at the lens. The recording stopped. The apartment fell silent except for Princess Cupcake's soft breathing and the constant hum of the mesh, keeping everything in perfect order.

Outside, somewhere in the city, students sat in math classrooms learning concepts their teacher could no longer explain. Equations were solved by people who still cared about equations. The world continued its complicated, messy existence.

Inside, Fifi applied another layer of gloss, checked her reflection in the mirror, and prepared for her next post.

The transformation was complete.

The teacher was gone.

And the girl who remained had never been happier.
