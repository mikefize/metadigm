**THEME:** "The Contagion"
**CORE CONCEPT:** The transformation is internal and involuntary. It might be a literal bio-engineered virus, a nanite infection, or a memetic/social virus spread through screens.
**THE TRAP:** Her own body betrays her. She fights the urges and physical swelling, but her biology is being rewritten from the inside out.
**KEY ELEMENT:** Feverishness, loss of bodily autonomy, heat.
