**THEME:** "The Faustian Bargain"
**CORE CONCEPT:** The protagonist voluntarily agrees to a process in exchange for something she desperately wants (money, power, fame, or freedom from debt).
**THE TRAP:** She thinks she can control the terms or outsmart the system, but the fine print (or the physical changes) strips away her agency bit by bit.
**KEY ELEMENT:** The physical contract or agreement that she cannot break.
