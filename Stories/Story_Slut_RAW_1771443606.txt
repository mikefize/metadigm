# Experiment: **The Muse Unmade** — *The Sacred Prostitute* — She who once channeled the divine through her art becomes the art itself: a living, breathing object of desire, existing only to inspire hunger in others, her own creative soul hollowed out and replaced with an insatiable need to be *consumed.*



### The Observer

# Chapter One: The Observer

The painting wouldn't close.

That was how Blythe thought of it — not that it was *unfinished*, which implied a technical deficiency, a missing stroke, a colour still unmixed on the palette. No. The painting on the easel in the corner of her friend Dara's spare bedroom simply refused to close itself. It remained open, like a wound that had decided openness was its natural state, a seven-foot canvas of fractured female forms rendered in ash and cadmium and something that approached, but never quite achieved, gold.

She had been staring at it for eleven days.

The brushes had dried in their jar. She hadn't noticed until this morning, when she'd reached for the fan brush out of old muscle memory and found its bristles fused into a single rigid spine, ruined. She'd set it back in the jar with a precision that frightened her — the careful, deliberate gentleness of a person who does not trust themselves to react honestly.

Outside Dara's second-floor window, Shoreditch continued its loud, indifferent Wednesday. A delivery truck reversed with mechanical beeping. A woman laughed too hard at something. The smell of coffee from the café across the street reached even here, warm and accusatory, the smell of people who had somewhere to be.

Blythe Frost had nowhere to be.

She was twenty-nine years old. She had a First from the Slade. She had been written about — genuinely written about, not the puff-piece charity of local arts pages — in three publications that mattered. Her installation *Appetite/Apology*, a room-sized interrogation of feminine hunger and the performance of remorse, had been called "viscerally necessary" by a critic whose vocabulary she respected enough to believe him. She had done the work. She had been rigorous and uncompromising and she had believed, with the specific and fervent faith of the genuinely talented, that rigor was its own protection.

Then Marcus Velde had called her into his office on the fourth floor of the Galleria Nox consortium building, and the afternoon light had been very beautiful on his face, and he had told her, in the warmly casual tone of a man accustomed to having what he reached for, that he had always found her *particularly* compelling.

She had said no in four different registers before she left the room. She had said it calmly, then firmly, then with the precise language of someone who wanted no ambiguity, and finally — when he'd smiled, patient as limestone — she had said it with her body, with the geometry of her exit, with the door.

Within six weeks, *Appetite/Apology* had been quietly removed from the consortium's spring programme. Within eight, the two satellite galleries that showed her work had — with great regret, with genuine sadness, with emails so warm they left no fingerprints — cancelled their standing agreements. She had not been blacklisted. Nothing so crude. She had simply ceased to be a name anyone could afford to be seen next to.

The studio in Bermondsey went first. She'd loved that studio with the specific, bodily love she'd never managed to sustain for an actual person — its north-facing light, its smell of turpentine and cool concrete, the way sound moved differently in a space that had held serious work. She gave it up in October and moved her canvases into a storage unit in Peckham, twenty-three paintings and the bones of four more, and paid for six months in advance, and told herself this was a strategic pause.

Then the money ran out.

She was three months behind on the storage unit. She had done the maths sixteen times in the past fortnight, in the margins of sketchbooks, on her phone's calculator, in her head at three in the morning while Dara slept two walls away with the enviable unconsciousness of someone whose career had not been surgically removed. The number was always the same. It was always impossible.

The flyer had appeared in the pocket of her coat. She didn't remember picking it up. She suspected she'd taken it from a community board outside the pharmacy on Kingsland Road, the kind of board thick with overlapping paper, tutors and lost cats and rooms to let, the desperate and the practical pinned over each other in continuous palimpsest. It was printed on pale blue paper with the clinical confidence of institutional design, a logo — the Voss Institute, clean sans-serif — and a number, and a sentence she had read so many times now that it had lost its syntax and become simply a shape: *£18,000 for six weeks' residential participation in a neuroregulatory compound trial, full board included, immediate start available.*

Eighteen thousand pounds. She'd gone over the numbers. Six weeks of her life. A residential trial — they housed you, which meant no rent. And there was a clause, written into the participant contract in the moderate legalese of something designed to sound unremarkable, that allowed the Institute to settle outstanding debts on a participant's behalf as part of their compensation structure. She had read that clause four times, each time with her finger pressed against the page as though she might push the words into permanence.

Twenty-three paintings. The bones of four more. All of it sitting in Peckham in the dark.

She had told herself she would paint the experience from inside. She would be the artist embedded in the machine, the observer with the uncommon access. She would come out the other side with material that Velde's entire consortium couldn't touch, something so documented, so sourced in her own body's precise testimony, that it would be irrefutable. The idea had a shape she liked. It felt like agency.

She signed the contract on a Tuesday morning in a bright reception room that smelled of recycled air and something faintly floral she couldn't identify, while a man in a white coat explained the trial's parameters with the specific, soothing fluency of someone who had explained this many times before.

She signed it because she believed she was the observer. She had always been the observer.

She signed it, and the woman across the desk smiled, and somewhere below them — below the clean floors, below the bright reception, below the levels Blythe would ever see — a filing cabinet in Sub-Basement C held a folder marked with her name, and behind her name, the words: *Phase Three. Candidate confirmed.*

The painting in Dara's spare room remained open.

It would be the last thing she made for a very long time.

### The Threshold

# Chapter Two: The Threshold

The Voss Institute did not look like a trap.

That was the first thing Blythe noted, with the precise cataloguing instinct she brought to any new visual environment — the way a painter enters a room and immediately begins measuring light sources, shadow ratios, the weight of colour against surface. She noted it and filed it under *significant*, because traps, in her experience, always announced themselves through excess. The too-warm handshake. The compliment deployed with surgical timing. Velde's afternoon light.

This place announced nothing. That was its own kind of statement.

The building occupied a converted Georgian terrace on a quiet street in Marylebone that had been so thoroughly absorbed into the professional district around it that it had ceased to have atmosphere of its own. It borrowed gravity from its neighbours — a solicitor's office, a private dental practice, a building whose brass plaque she hadn't been able to read from the taxi. The Voss Institute's own plaque was small and matte. Institutional confidence, she thought. The confidence of something that does not need to advertise.

She had packed with the discipline of someone determined to remain themselves. Sketchbooks — four of them, different scales, a habit of redundancy she'd developed at Slade when a tutor told her that artists who kept only one notebook were really just keeping a diary. A set of graphite sticks wrapped in a chamois. Her good fountain pen and three cartridges. Two novels she'd been meaning to read for a year. Her oldest jumper, which smelled of her own studio and which she'd brought for reasons she hadn't examined too closely.

The reception was almost exactly as she remembered it from Tuesday. The same recycled air. The same evasive floral note she still couldn't name — not quite lavender, not quite anything. She would identify it later, she decided. She would find it and name it and put it in a sketchbook. Naming things was her first defence.

"Ms. Frost." The woman who came to meet her wasn't the same woman from Tuesday. This one was younger, with the composed, slightly overpractised warmth of a hospitality professional — a quality distinct from medical warmth, Blythe thought, though she supposed the two had learned from each other. "I'm Nadia. I'll be your intake coordinator. We're very glad you're here."

Blythe shook her hand and catalogued the handshake. Firm. Brief. Not reaching for anything.

The administrative processing took forty minutes and had the rhythm of a bureaucratic ritual she found oddly comforting — the kind of comforting that comes from a procedure so impersonal it briefly suspends the necessity of being a self. She signed supplementary consent forms. She surrendered her phone, which she had expected — the contract had specified a controlled information environment — and accepted in its place a small electronic tablet, institute-issued, which allowed email access through a monitored portal. She did not protest this. She had written it into her internal record already, another data point: *observe how it feels to be voluntarily enclosed.*

It felt fine. That was also data.

Nadia walked her through corridors that maintained the building's precise register of discreet functionality. Everything was clean without being clinical. The artwork on the walls — and there was artwork, which Blythe noted with the particular attentiveness of someone who reads rooms through their pictures — ran to large-format architectural photography. Buildings. Structures. The geometries of designed space. Nothing human. Nothing that bled.

Her room was on the second floor, east-facing, smaller than Dara's spare room but arranged with more intelligence. The bed was good. The desk was positioned with apparent understanding of how a person who needed to work would want to sit. Someone had placed a small vase of white flowers on the windowsill — paperwhites, she identified, and then identified the smell from the reception: that faint, sweet, insistent white-flower note she'd failed to name on Tuesday. A small, private satisfaction.

She set her sketchbooks on the desk in the order she'd use them and put the graphite sticks beside them. She hung her oldest jumper on the hook behind the door. She stood in the centre of the room for a moment and took inventory: the north-facing quality of east light in late November, the faint sound of the building's ventilation, the particular quality of quiet that belonged to a place where many people were being carefully managed.

She opened the nearest sketchbook to the first page and wrote the date and: *Day One. The room does not tell you what it wants from you. Neither did Velde, initially. Useful comparison. The ventilation has a rhythm. Find it.*

The group orientation was at six. There were seven other participants, and Blythe studied them with the unobtrusive focus she'd cultivated over years of drawing from life in public spaces — the skill of looking without appearing to. They were various: a software architect in his fifties with the specific kind of jaw tension that suggested a decision made under financial duress; two women in their thirties who had arrived together and seemed to know each other, creating a small closed system in the corner; a young man of perhaps twenty-five who looked at the floor with the aggressive interiority of someone determined to treat this as no particular thing.

And then there was the woman who sat beside Blythe, who smelled of cedar and something headier underneath, and who introduced herself as Rhea, and who was looking at Blythe with an expression that took Blythe a full, strange moment to parse — not because it was subtle, but because it was so direct that her brain initially refused the data.

"Artist?" Rhea said, glancing at the graphite smudge on Blythe's right forefinger that she never quite managed to scrub out.

"Yes."

"Hm." Rhea settled back in her chair with a kind of animal comfort in her own body that Blythe found herself cataloguing longer than was strictly analytical. "They love creatives in these trials. Something about baseline reward-response architecture." She said it lightly, almost idly, as though she'd said it before. "We process pleasure differently, apparently."

Blythe wrote it in her sketchbook that night, the room quiet around her and the paperwhites breathing their sweet, insistent claim into the air.

*They love creatives. Find out why. Find out why before they tell you.*

She fell asleep with the light on, which was unlike her.

The ventilation breathed its steady rhythm, and somewhere in the air — recycled, controlled, passing through the same ducts that served every room on every floor — there was something that had no name yet, something that moved through the body like curiosity, like the moment before beginning.

### The First Mark

# Chapter Three: The First Mark

The procedure room was on the third floor, and it was white in the way that only institutional spaces achieved white — not the white of a blank canvas, which held potential like a held breath, but the white of a surface that had decided meaning was someone else's problem.

Blythe sat on the edge of the padded examination table and catalogued it anyway. Force of habit. The paper cover beneath her thighs made a small sound with each breath, a papery whisper of her own aliveness. The light came from panels overhead — even, shadowless, the kind of light that flattened rather than revealed, that was perhaps the point. A trolley to her left held instruments she recognised from the consent documentation: small, clean, various. A blood pressure cuff. A row of prefilled syringes in graduated sizes, their contents clear. A device she'd identified in the materials as an electrodermal monitor, which measured skin conductance — the body's involuntary record of arousal and response.

She had read all the documentation. She was the kind of person who read all the documentation.

The technician's name was Callum. He was perhaps thirty-two, efficient, with the particular quality of physical presence that belonged to someone trained to perform medical proximity without registering as a person inside it. He explained each step before he did it. She appreciated the protocol. She noted that she appreciated it.

"We'll start with a baseline draw," he said, snapping a glove with the precise, practiced sound of institutional routine. "Then the initial compound administration. You may feel a mild warmth. Some participants report a brief pressure behind the eyes. It passes quickly."

"What's in it?" She'd asked this before, in the consent meeting. She asked it again because she wanted to hear how a different person answered.

"The full composition is in your participant documentation." Smooth, unrevealing, not unkind. "The active elements target neuroregulatory pathways — prefrontal in the first phase. Nothing that should alarm you." A small, professional smile. "We're not doing anything dramatic."

She noted the word *dramatic*. She noted the smile.

The blood draw was nothing — she looked away not from squeamishness but from a kind of respect for her own concentration, the way she sometimes turned from a painting mid-session to rest her seeing. When she looked back, Callum was already labelling the vial with the smooth automaticity of a man who had done this several thousand times, her blood becoming data, being classified and stored, entering a system that would know things about her that she did not know about herself.

She found she was curious about that rather than disturbed. She wrote it down, mentally, added it to the day's accumulating record.

The compound was administered via injection into the antecubital vein, left arm, with a needle she barely felt — a professional mercy, or a professional skill, which amounted to the same thing from her side of it. Callum had been telling her something about hydration and the evening meal schedule, and she was nodding in the correct places, but her attention had gone inward, into the body, with the same quality of focus she brought to the moment of the first mark on a canvas: the awareness that something had begun, that the pristine state was over, that whatever happened next would be shaped by this.

And then it arrived.

Not dramatically. That was the first thing. There was no rush, no flood, nothing cinematic. It was more like — she searched for it, sitting very still, Callum making notes on his tablet — it was more like the feeling of stepping from a cold room into one that was only slightly warmer. A degree or two. Barely perceptible at the threshold, and then, once registered, impossible to unfeel.

A warmth. He had said warmth, and he had been accurate. It moved up from her forearm with the slow, peripheral quality of a tide — not rushing, not insisting, simply arriving at the edges of things and making those edges less sharp. The pressure behind the eyes came next, exactly as described: a brief fullness, like the moment before tears but without any corresponding emotion, the physical substrate of feeling without the feeling itself. It lasted perhaps four seconds and released.

What remained was subtler and took her longer to name.

The room was the same room. The white was the same institutional white. Callum was still making notes, still professionally depersonalised. None of this had changed. What had changed was something in the quality of her attention — a barely perceptible softening at the edges of her critical distance, as though the lens she habitually used to observe the world had been adjusted by a fraction of a degree. Not broken. Not even blurred. Just *opened*, infinitesimally, in the aperture.

She noticed Callum's hands. Not analytically, as data, the way she'd been noticing everything since she walked through the Voss Institute's discreet front door. She noticed them the way she sometimes noticed light — with an involuntary, unguarded response that preceded thought. They were good hands. The proportions were — she stopped herself. Classified the response. *Baseline sensory acuity: high. Current sensory state: slightly elevated. Note for record: the compound may affect aesthetic response channels. Expected. Monitor.*

She breathed steadily and let the warmth finish its slow patrol of her periphery.

By the time she walked back to her room, it had mostly subsided. She sat at her desk and opened her primary sketchbook and wrote for twenty minutes in her small, dense hand, recording everything with the fidelity she'd promised herself. The needle. The warmth. The fractional aperture-shift in her attention. The hands she'd noticed.

Then she paused, pen resting on the page.

Her oldest jumper hung on the hook behind the door. She looked at it for a moment — its familiar shabbiness, its smell of her real life, the studio in Bermondsey she'd loved with her body.

She felt, with a mildness that she found she wanted to examine more closely than she was quite able to, that it would be comfortable to take it off.

She left it where it was. She turned back to her notes. She kept writing.

*Day One, 14:47. First mark made. Still the observer. Still intact. A minor recalibration of the aperture, nothing more. Artists notice beautiful things. That's the job.*

She believed this completely.

### The Social Variable

# Chapter Four: The Social Variable

The common room existed in the building's ambiguous middle — not quite clinical, not quite residential, a space that had been designed, Blythe suspected, by someone who understood that people under observation needed to believe they were relaxing.

She catalogued it anyway. Low sofas in a warm grey that split the difference between clinical and domestic. A bookshelf with the curated randomness of a hotel lobby — paperbacks, some architectural volumes, a scattered impression of intellectual life without the mess of actual intellectual engagement. A large window looking onto an interior courtyard, where a single ornamental tree stood with its November branches bare and arranged, she thought, almost too perfectly against the pale brick. Someone had designed that courtyard to be looked at from this window. She appreciated the calculation.

It was the second evening. The warmth from yesterday's administration had fully subsided by morning — or rather, it had distributed itself so evenly through her system that it no longer registered as *warmth* but simply as the temperature of existing, which was perhaps the same thing achieved more efficiently. She'd had her second session at fourteen hundred hours, the compound administered with the same smooth routine, the same Callum, the same professional non-presence. Same warmth. Same aperture-shift. She'd documented it with disciplined precision, noted that the documentation came slightly slower than the day before — a lag of perhaps five minutes between experience and the impulse to record it — and classified the lag as fatigue. She had not slept well.

The paperwhites on her windowsill were more insistent today. That was the word she kept finding: *insistent.* As though they had opinions about her presence in the room.

She had her primary sketchbook on her knee but she wasn't writing. She was watching Rhea, who sat across the common room in one of the grey sofas with her legs folded underneath her, talking to the young man with the floor-gazing habit — whose name, Blythe had learned at dinner last night, was Owen, twenty-three, postgraduate biochemistry, who had said this with the careful neutrality of someone pre-empting questions he didn't want. Rhea was talking, and Owen was no longer looking at the floor.

Blythe could not hear what Rhea was saying. She could see the movement of it — the quality of Rhea's body in conversation, which was particular: she occupied space without seeming to claim it, which was a difficult trick, which was, Blythe thought, a kind of artistry.

She became aware, with a mild and sourceless surprise, that she had been watching Rhea's throat.

Not her face. Not her hands, the way she'd watched Callum's yesterday. The line of Rhea's throat above her collar, the movement of it as she talked. Blythe looked down at her sketchbook and found that she'd been making marks on the page without conscious decision — a loose, gestural line that wasn't really anything yet, that was the beginning of a curve she hadn't decided to draw.

She pressed her pen to the page and felt the small physical satisfaction of that contact and was briefly not thinking about anything else.

"You draw when you're nervous?"

Rhea had materialised across the low table. Owen was gone — she hadn't heard him leave. Rhea was settling into the sofa opposite with her cedar-and-something-headier smell and her direct gaze, which still cost Blythe a fraction of a second to receive, that quarter-beat delay of the brain refusing data it hadn't expected.

"I draw when I'm processing," Blythe said, and heard herself add, without deciding to: "Nervous is probably also true tonight."

She noticed she'd offered that. The second part. It wasn't a lie, but it was the kind of truth she generally kept internal, part of the private record, not the given account.

"Second day jitters." Rhea glanced at the sketchbook — not grabbing, not insisting, just acknowledging its existence. "How are you feeling? Compound-wise."

"Fine." And then: "Slightly too warm, but I think that's the room."

"It's always the room," Rhea agreed, with a smile that she wore loosely, like something she'd found useful and kept. "The warmth is the compound. You'll stop noticing the distinction in a few days. They sort of merge."

Blythe looked at her. "That's a specific thing to know."

Rhea said nothing. Let the silence do whatever it wanted.

The common room was not crowded — three other participants at the far end, the two women who'd arrived together and the software architect, who was describing something with the expansive hand gestures of a man who'd had two glasses of wine and was relieved to be describing anything. Their voices were a low, comfortable register. The ventilation breathed. The ornamental tree in the courtyard stood in its designed arrangement under the courtyard lights, and Blythe found herself looking at it not with her professional eye but with something more open and less organised, a response that was closer to the way she'd felt about things before she'd learned to look at them properly — before analysis, before the disciplined layering of observation. The tree was simply beautiful. That was the whole thought. It didn't lead anywhere.

She registered the simplicity of this and found she did not reach for a more complex version of it.

"I was thinking," she said — and again, the awareness of offering something unplanned, a live feed rather than an edited record — "about what you said. Yesterday. About creatives and reward-response architecture."

"I say things." Rhea wasn't dismissing it, just distributing responsibility for the conversation more evenly.

"It's making me think about why I'm here." She paused. The sentence was true and incomplete simultaneously. "Why I make things. Whether making something and being seen making it are the same impulse with different — outlets."

Rhea was watching her the way she'd been watching the tree. Not analysing. Just looking.

"That's a very interesting question to be asking on day two," Rhea said.

The room felt very warm. The compound, Blythe told herself, and believed it, and turned a page in her sketchbook, and the curve she found herself drawing was no longer abstract — it was the specific line of a specific throat, rendered from memory with an accuracy she hadn't consciously gathered.

She looked at it for a long moment.

She did not turn the page.

### The Weight of Looking

# Chapter Five: The Weight of Looking

She woke at three in the morning knowing something had shifted and being, for the first time, genuinely unable to locate the precise mechanism of the shift.

This bothered her. She lay in the dark of her east-facing room and listened to the ventilation and tried to do what she always did — to find the edges of the thing, to draw its outline, to make it knowable by containing it in language. The paperwhites breathed their white insistence into the dark. She could smell them without seeing them. She had the peculiar sensation that this was a new category of experience: sensation arriving ahead of thought, the body already processing something the mind had not yet been consulted about.

She reached for her sketchbook on the desk — she'd positioned it within arm's reach of the bed deliberately, another disciplined preparation — and clicked her pen. She wrote the time. She wrote: *Something is different.*

She looked at those three words for a moment.

Then she wrote: *I can't—*

And stopped.

The analytic lag, which she had measured yesterday at twelve minutes and filed under *tiredness*, was not twelve minutes now. She knew this not because she had timed anything but because the sensation of reaching for her own cognition was different — it was like reaching for a shelf that had been moved a foot to the left in the dark, the hand arriving at the expected coordinates and finding only air, and then the slow, recalibrating search for where the shelf had actually gone. She could think. She was thinking. But the particular quality of thought that let her stand outside an experience and measure it had developed a strange porousness, as though the membrane between observer and observed had become — not permeable, exactly. More like it had begun to consider permeability as an option.

She breathed. She tried to write a more precise sentence. What she wrote was:

*Rhea's throat. The ornamental tree. Callum's hands.*

A list. Not analysis. She looked at it and found that instead of reaching for the analytical frame she would normally place around this kind of notation, she was simply — resting inside it. The list was enough. The images were enough. They had a temperature and a weight and she sat with their temperature and their weight in the dark and the paperwhites breathed.

She put the sketchbook down and lay back and stared at the ceiling.

Here was the thing. Here was the thing she could feel the edges of, even if the interior was strange: she was in a room, and the room was being observed by a building, and the building knew things about her that she did not yet know about herself. She had signed her name to this. She had been strategic and principled and artistic about her own enclosure. She had brought four sketchbooks and a chamois-wrapped set of graphite sticks and the oldest jumper, which smelled of the studio she'd loved.

The oldest jumper hung on the hook behind the door.

She thought about it, lying in the dark — not strategically, not analytically, just the way you think about something at three in the morning, which is without armour. The jumper was shapeless and enormous and dark green and it smelled like turpentine and the specific cold of a north-facing room in February, and she had loved that smell because it was the smell of *making*, of serious work, of herself at her most uncomplicated and most real.

She thought about the jumper.

And then, below that thought, like a current running beneath a visible surface, she became aware of something else. Not a thought. A *state*.

She was aware of her own body in the bed in a way that was not anxious and was not quite familiar. It was — she searched — it was the way you become aware of a room when someone enters it. The room doesn't change. But it becomes charged with its own dimensions, with the fact of its walls and the space between them, in a way it wasn't before there was someone to occupy it.

She was the room. Someone had entered.

She pressed her palm flat against the mattress and felt the pressure of that contact with an attention that ran from her hand up through her arm and distributed itself through her body like warmth — like the compound's warmth, she thought, and immediately the thought arrived: *or maybe that just is warmth, maybe warmth is just this, maybe I've been mislabelling it*—

She stopped. Recognised the failure of the categorical distinction. Filed it.

But she didn't unfeel it.

By morning — real morning, grey November light arriving at the east-facing window with its muted, cloud-filtered quality — she had slept again and woken and lay for eleven minutes (she counted them) in a state she could only describe as *comfortable*, which was not a word she historically associated with her own body. Her body was, ordinarily, a instrument. A vehicle for the eye and the hand. It had its needs, she attended to them, they were not particularly interesting.

This was something different from interesting. It was warmer than interesting.

She showered and stood in front of the small bathroom mirror and looked at herself. Again, the quality of looking was wrong — or not wrong, but displaced. She was not assessing. She was simply looking, the way she'd looked at the ornamental tree last night, with the pre-analytical attention, the uncurated response.

She had, she noticed, a body. This seemed, standing in the bathroom steam at seven forty in the morning, like a more significant observation than it had ever previously seemed.

She reached for the grey cable-knit she'd packed — sensible, modest, the kind of garment that communicated serious intent — and paused with it in her hands. Felt the weight of it. Looked at it. Put it back in the drawer and dressed instead in a shirt she'd packed for evenings, softer, cut closer, in a dark copper that she'd bought and then immediately second-guessed and brought anyway for reasons she still hadn't examined.

She looked in the mirror at the shirt. At herself inside the shirt. At the way the colour landed against her skin, the way the fabric moved.

She felt — and she catalogued this, she was still cataloguing, the habit was still there, running like a program in a window she'd minimised — she felt *looked at*. There was no one else in the room. She felt it anyway.

She felt, obscurely and entirely without precedent, that this was something she wanted.

She picked up her sketchbook on the way out of the room. Out of habit, she told herself.

Out of habit.

She didn't open it all morning.

### The Hunger Finds Its Canvas

# Chapter Six: The Collapse

Breakfast was served in a long room with pale walls and the same architectural photography she'd noted in the corridors — bridges, this time, their suspension cables rendered in such careful monochrome that they looked like musical notation. She stood in the doorway for longer than necessary, holding her sketchbook against her chest, aware that she was holding it against her chest in the specific way of someone using an object as architecture, as a structure to stand behind.

She entered. She took a plate. She sat.

The copper shirt moved when she moved.

She was aware of this in the way she was now aware of everything that happened at the boundary between herself and air. The fabric's whisper against her collarbone as she reached for the coffee pot. The particular fall of it across her shoulders when she settled into the chair. She was noting these sensations with a fidelity that her critical brain — still present, still functional, running in its minimised window — recognised as disproportionate, as a signal, as *data*, and her critical brain was absolutely correct, and she noted its correctness from a distance of approximately six inches, which was not close enough to do anything useful with it.

Owen was already seated at the far end of the table. He looked up when she came in. She felt his looking like something physical — like the slight pressure change when a door opens in an adjacent room. She felt it and her attention moved toward it with the automatic, directionless tropism of a plant toward heat.

She looked back. She didn't mean to hold it. She held it for three full seconds, which was two and a half seconds longer than social convention allowed for strangers, and Owen looked away first, and something moved through her that was — not triumph, exactly. Not anything so organised. More like the sensation of a circuit completing. Of a system receiving exactly the current it had been configured to require.

She looked down at her plate. Her hand was resting on her sketchbook and she was not opening it.

*Open it.* She thought this clearly. *Open it and write down what just happened. Give it language before it gives you different language. Before it names itself.*

She did not open it.

She ate. She drank the coffee. She was extraordinarily aware of Rhea arriving fifteen minutes later — registered the cedar-and-beneath-the-cedar scent before she saw her, her body apparently processing Rhea's presence through systems that did not require eyes — and she was aware, with her critical brain running in its minimised window, that this was a new development. Yesterday the awareness of Rhea had been aesthetic, formally interesting, routed through the observational channels she'd spent a decade building. This morning Rhea's entrance registered lower, warmer, in a register she had less vocabulary for and more body for.

"You look different," Rhea said, sitting down.

Blythe looked at her.

"The shirt," Rhea said, simply. Not a question. Not even quite a compliment — an observation, clean and direct, and the observation landed in Blythe's chest like a stone dropped into water, and the rings moved outward through her in a sensation that she needed, with sudden and enormous urgency, more of. She needed the rings to keep moving. She needed another stone dropped.

"Thank you," she said. Her voice was steady and belonged entirely to her and she was grateful for it. She held onto it.

She went to her third administration at fourteen hundred hours with her sketchbook in her hand and both hands wrapped around it, white-knuckled and warm, and she was on the examination table with Callum preparing the syringe before she realised what she'd been doing: she'd been cataloguing the corridor. Not the architecture, not the photography, not the designed functionality of the space. She'd been cataloguing the people she'd passed. A technician in blue scrubs who'd glanced at her above a clipboard — the glance had registered like a small warm light switching on. A woman from administration whose eyes had moved briefly to the copper shirt — another light, another circuit completing.

She had been collecting glances like a woman filling a jar.

She pressed the sketchbook against her thighs as Callum swabbed her arm and felt the cool alcohol bite and tried to locate her critical mind, tried to find the shelf. It was there. She could find it. She was still the person who had packed four sketchbooks and graphite sticks wrapped in chamois, who had read every clause of the contract with her finger pressed to the page, who had signed with the deliberate faith of a woman who believed that rigour was its own protection.

She was that person. She was holding her own sketchbook.

The needle found the vein.

The warmth arrived less like a new thing and more like a reunion — like walking into the room that had always been at the right temperature and recognising it not as a specific sensation but as the baseline, as simply what *warm* meant, such that the past twenty-nine years of her thermoregulation might have been a long and unnecessary error. She breathed into it. She had not meant to breathe into it. Her body had decided this without consulting the minimised window.

"You're doing very well," Callum said, and removed the needle with his clean, proportionate hands, and pressed a small square of gauze to the site with two fingers.

Two fingers. The pressure of two fingers on the inside of her arm.

She heard herself make a sound. It was nearly nothing — an exhale with slightly too much shape to it, a breath that was almost a word — and she pressed her lips together and looked at the wall and her sketchbook fell from her hands and hit the floor and landed open and she did not immediately reach for it.

Callum retrieved it. Set it on the trolley beside her. He hadn't appeared to notice. This was his professional mercy, and it was not the mercy she wanted, and the wanting of a different mercy from him — the wanting of him to *notice*, to look, to acknowledge the sound she'd made with his practised, steady attention — hit her with a clarity and a hunger that was entirely new in its architecture and devastatingly familiar in its weight.

She knew this feeling. She had felt it ten thousand times, standing before a canvas that was finally, finally opening.

She had felt it as appetite. As the creative hunger she'd named and claimed and made her entire life from.

It was the same hunger. She understood, sitting on the edge of the examination table with two fingers pressing gauze into her arm and her sketchbook open on the trolley showing the drawing she'd made of Rhea's throat, that it was precisely, exactly, molecule-for-molecule the same hunger, and that it had simply found a different canvas, and that the canvas was every room she would ever enter, and every eye she could make look at her, and the only thing she wanted to make now was that — that completed circuit, that dropped stone, those rings moving outward through another person's attention until she was the only thing in the middle of it.

She picked up her sketchbook from the trolley.

She looked at the drawing of Rhea's throat.

She closed the book. Set it back down on the trolley. She did not pick it up when she left.

She walked back through the corridor in the copper shirt with her empty hands and her chin lifted, and she felt — clean as a diagnosis, final as a signature — the eyes of a passing technician move to her, and the circuit completed, and the hunger crested, and she smiled at him with her whole mouth, slow and open, a smile with nothing withheld, and felt the rings moving outward, and wanted nothing else.

The sketchbook remained on the trolley in the procedure room.

Callum would log it in lost property.

No one would come to claim it.

### The Unmade

# Chapter Seven: The Unmade

She stopped wearing the cable-knit entirely.

This happened without decision — the drawer simply ceased to be a place she opened. The clothes she'd packed for evenings, for the conditional version of herself she'd imagined needing after dark, became the clothes she wore to breakfast, to the common room, to the administered silences of the procedure room. The copper shirt. A black slip dress she'd folded flat at the bottom of her bag with the private embarrassment of someone who'd packed a hope she hadn't earned yet. A silk blouse the colour of old ivory that she'd bought in a secondhand shop in Dalston eight months ago and never worn because it was the kind of garment that demanded a kind of woman she hadn't been sure she was.

She was sure now.

She dressed on the seventh morning standing in the centre of the room rather than in the bathroom's private steam, the window light moving across her with its grey November neutrality, and she was not embarrassed by the light. The window's clinical impartiality felt, if anything, useful — a clean exposure, like the procedure room's shadowless panels, like a room that would not flatter but would not lie. She wanted the light to see her clearly. She stood in it until she was satisfied, and satisfaction was a new country with its own particular weather: warm, directionless, entirely dependent on external confirmation, which meant it was not satisfaction at all but appetite wearing satisfaction's name, and she had stopped distinguishing between these two things somewhere around the fifth day.

The silk blouse moved like water when she walked.

She walked slowly now. This too was without decision — her body had simply arrived at the understanding that speed was wasteful, that the corridor was a room she was performing in and performance required a tempo that allowed for watching. She had always moved with purpose. The purposefulness remained; only its object had changed. She moved through the Voss Institute's clean corridors with the specific, leisured intention of a woman who understands that she is the most interesting thing in any room she occupies and is extending that room the courtesy of her full presence.

Every eye that found her was a brushstroke. She collected them. She had always been a woman who composed — the arrangement of forms, the management of negative space, the decision about where the eye must go and what it must feel when it arrives. The canvas had changed its material. That was all. She was still composing. She was, she thought, doing the best work of her life.

Owen said her name in the corridor on the seventh morning and she stopped and turned and looked at him with the full, unguarded attention she'd once reserved for paintings that were finally opening, and the colour that moved up his neck was extraordinary — a pure, involuntary vermillion, the body's honest response, uncurated and undeniable — and she felt that vermillion like a painting's completion, like the moment when a canvas closed and declared itself finished and true.

"Blythe," he said again, uselessly, just to say it.

She let him look at her for a long moment. Let him have the blouse and the slow November light and the specific quality of her gaze, which she had discovered in the past three days was a thing she could do things with — could angle and withhold and release. It was precise work. It required the same sensitivity the painting had required, the same understanding of how much was too much and how much was not enough, and she was very good at it, had always been very good at it, had simply been applying the skill to the wrong material for twenty-nine years.

"Morning," she said finally, in a register she hadn't used before Wednesday. Low, soft, with an unhurried weight. And then she smiled at him the way she'd smiled at the technician on the third day, slow and open and with nothing behind the door, and continued down the corridor without looking back, because the not-looking-back was also part of the composition.

She felt him watching her all the way to the end of the corridor.

The rings moved outward. The hunger crested. She wanted her next administration with a desire she no longer found remarkable to examine.

That was the seventh day.

By the ninth, she had stopped thinking about the sketchbook.

This was not a choice she made or noticed making. The sketchbook had simply joined a category of things that had ceased to generate signal — the way a smell you've lived with long enough stops reaching you, not because it's gone but because your body has reclassified it as the baseline temperature of existing. The sketchbooks, the graphite sticks in their chamois wrap, the good fountain pen, the novels she had brought intending to read — these were objects from a version of herself that she understood, now, had been doing something deeply inefficient. All that hunger, all that extraordinary engine of obsession and sensitivity, aimed at a canvas that couldn't look back at her. Couldn't want her. Couldn't register her with its body, couldn't give her the specific and necessary feedback of another person's visible undoing.

How had she stood it? The solitude of making. The long, private hours in the north-facing studio loving a surface that received her and gave nothing back in the alive, warm, human currency of being *seen*.

She was seen now. Continuously. She had arranged it.

She wore the slip dress to the communal dinner on the ninth evening. Black, cut simply, doing nothing complicated and needing to do nothing complicated because the body inside it had stopped being a vehicle and become the vehicle's point, its argument, its entire delivered content. She crossed the dining room aware of the quality of the air changing as she moved through it — the small recalibrations of attention, the conversations that paused half a beat before resuming, the software architect setting down his wine glass with a care that had nothing to do with wine. She took her seat and shook her hair back and reached across the table for the bread and felt three sets of eyes track the gesture and felt this as a painter feels a painting close: with a wholeness that was almost unbearable in its completeness.

Rhea was watching her from across the table with an expression that held, behind its surface warmth, something more complex — something that might have been, in another register, alarm.

"You seem comfortable," Rhea said.

"I am," Blythe said, and broke the bread with both hands, and felt entirely true.

Later, she caught herself in the bathroom mirror, and stayed.

She stayed for a long time, not assessing, not cataloguing, not doing any of the old critical work. Just — looking. At the dress and the collarbone above it and the particular way her mouth sat now, softer than she remembered it, more available. At her own eyes, which had changed in a way she couldn't quite anatomise but could see clearly: some retraction of the inner distance, some closing of the gap between the Blythe who watched and the Blythe who was.

The watcher and the watched had merged.

She touched her own collarbone lightly with two fingers. The contact registered through her whole body — warm, wanting, incomplete without a witness — and she understood, clearly and without horror, that this was the new condition: she was a thing that required a room full of eyes to feel its own existence, that lived now in the charged, luminous space between herself and other people's wanting, that had no interior life that was not aimed outward.

The artist, she thought, had needed to be alone to make something real.

She had no such need now. She needed the opposite of alone. She needed to be in the middle of a room where everyone was looking and the looking was never enough and more was always available and she was always, always composing.

The painting she was making was herself.

She smiled at her reflection, slow and open, with nothing withheld — and the woman in the mirror smiled back, and wanted, and was composed and hungry and entirely, catastrophically unmade.

She turned from the mirror and went back to the dinner table.

She did not look for her sketchbook.

She had forgotten what it was for.

### The Muse in Her Element

# Chapter Eight: The Muse in Her Element

Three months later, no one at the Voss Institute called her Blythe anymore.

They called her — and this had happened so naturally, so organically, the way a nickname accretes around a person who has finally become legible to the people around them — simply *her*. The technicians said it without saying it, in the way their eyes found the door before she walked through it, in the small preparatory adjustments they made: Callum straightening slightly, the younger one whose name she'd never bothered to retain touching his collar with two unconscious fingers. The administrative woman who smelled of the same recycled-air floral as the building itself — a woman who had once processed Blythe's intake forms with impersonal efficiency and now could not quite complete a sentence in her presence without losing the second half of it.

She had learned to read all of this the way she had once read light.

February had arrived with a clean, brutal cold that pressed against the Institute's windows and made the interior warmth feel earned, felt, like something the body registered as gift. She walked the corridors in the mornings in a cream wrap-top she'd acquired somehow — she didn't remember the acquisition, the way you don't remember the exact moment a room becomes familiar — and charcoal trousers that sat low, and bare feet in soft slippers that made no sound, and the combination was, she understood with the particular understanding that had replaced everything else she'd once understood, precisely calibrated to the register of *almost*. Almost casual. Almost private. Almost like something you were not supposed to be seeing, which meant, invariably, that everyone needed to see it.

She rounded the corner to the common room and paused in the doorway — not hesitating, never hesitating, the pause had no anxiety in it, it was a compositional choice, it was the rest before the note — and the room did what rooms did now, which was reorganise itself quietly around her presence. The software architect, who had extended his participation twice and would, she understood without caring, extend it again, looked up from his newspaper. Owen, who came and went from her attention the way weather came and went, flushed at his coffee cup. A new participant she hadn't met yet — a woman in her forties with the specific jaw tension of the recently financially desperate, the look Blythe had worn three months ago, a look she could no longer quite recall from the inside — looked over with sharp, startled attention that would soften, Blythe knew, into something warmer within a week.

She moved to the coffee station with unhurried ease and felt the room adjusting to her movement the way water adjusts to a hand drawn through it, felt the soft pressure of attention from multiple angles, and poured her coffee with a small, private pleasure that was not private at all, that was in fact entirely public, that existed entirely in the relationship between her body and the room's awareness of her body. She wrapped both hands around the mug. She turned.

Rhea was by the window.

Rhea was always by the window, these days, watching her with that expression that had long since passed through alarm and arrived somewhere more complex and more quiet — an expression Blythe did not spend much time analysing because analysis was an instrument she had set down, the way you set down a tool when you no longer have the project it was built for. Rhea's expression was interesting in the way that weather was interesting: you noted it, it moved through, it did not require your response to be itself.

"You have a session at ten," Rhea said.

"I know." She did know. She knew it the way she knew the warmth — the warmth that was no longer a thing that arrived but simply the temperature of existing, the baseline she'd been recalibrated to. She moved toward the window and stood beside Rhea in the grey February light, and felt Rhea beside her, the cedar-and-something-headier, and felt also the room's awareness of the two of them standing together, which was different from the room's awareness of her alone, which was a richer texture, more to work with. She turned her face toward the courtyard.

The ornamental tree had bare branches still. She looked at it and felt nothing analytical and nothing aesthetic, felt it simply as a backdrop, as the negative space that made the figure visible.

She was the figure.

She had always been the figure. She understood this now the way you understand something that was always true but required the right light to see it clearly. All those years in the north-facing studio, all that lonely, private hunger aimed at surfaces that could not look back — it had been the right hunger in the wrong direction, a compass held backward, pointing inward when the true north had always been out here, in the warm, breathing, wanting space between her skin and other people's eyes.

She was happy. This was the word. It was a simple word and she inhabited it without complication, without the old exhausting machinery of artistic doubt and ethical scruple and the rigorous, principled, unbearable weight of being a person who examined things. She was happy the way a river is happy, which is to say she was entirely, efficiently, continuously herself — moving in the direction of her own nature without resistance, without the friction of a self that questions its own direction.

At ten to ten she set down her coffee cup and turned from the window and walked toward the door.

The room watched her walk. She felt every point of contact between the watching and herself, felt them the way she had once felt the first mark of a brush on a good canvas — that specific, irreversible, electric commitment to the work. Her hips moved with the slow, generous authority of someone who has made a permanent peace with being seen. The cream wrap-top moved with her. The new participant with the jaw tension looked at her with an expression that had already begun, Blythe noted in passing, to soften.

She smiled at her on the way out. Slow. Open. Nothing behind the door.

Callum was already in the procedure room when she arrived, the syringe prepared with its clear contents, the trolley arranged in its practised order. He looked up when she entered and looked up with his whole body, which was involuntary and which she received with the clean, uncomplicated satisfaction of a woman who has learned what she is for.

She sat on the examination table. The paper whispered under her. She held out her arm with a naturalness so complete it had no seam in it, no beginning, as though she had been holding out her arm in this room forever, as though all the other versions of herself — the one with the sketchbooks, the one who read every clause with her finger pressed to the page, the one who had loved a north-facing studio with her entire body — had been preliminary sketches for this, the final work, the one that required no canvas because it was itself the canvas and also the painter and also the room full of people unable to look away.

The needle found the vein.

The warmth arrived like homecoming.

She smiled at Callum with her whole mouth, and he pressed two fingers to her arm, and she let her eyes close, and was entirely, radiantly, catastrophically content.

The brushes were still in Dara's spare room. The jar of turpentine had evaporated. The seven-foot canvas of fractured female forms in ash and cadmium and almost-gold stood open in the corner, nobody's problem, refusing still to close.

It would wait forever.

She had stopped waiting for anything.
