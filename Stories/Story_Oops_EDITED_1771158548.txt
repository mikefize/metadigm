# Experiment: The Plastique Princess

### Chapter 1: The Prometheus Protocol

The fluorescent lights in Lab 7 hummed their sterile lullaby at 11:47 PM, casting Ursula Graves's shadow across three years of research reduced to smoking ruins. Her fingers trembled against the rim of her coffee mug—cold now, a skin of cream congealed on the surface—as she stared at the fabricated chromatography results splashed across her monitor.

Someone had salted her data. Deliberately. Methodically.

The clinical trial results for NeuraBright showed a 94% cognitive enhancement rate in her original documentation. The files currently residing on the FDA's servers—the ones that would determine whether her career ended in a congressional hearing or a Nobel nomination—showed a 23% rate with significant adverse effects. Effects she'd never observed. Results from tests she'd never conducted.

"Fuck." The word escaped through clenched teeth, sharp and inadequate.

Ursula stood, her lab coat swishing against pencil-skirt fabric as she paced the narrow corridor between workstations. At thirty-one, she'd already published seventeen papers in peer-reviewed journals. Her work on neuroplasticity and cognitive enhancement had attracted Pentagon interest, pharmaceutical company courtship, and the kind of professional jealousy that apparently manifested in career assassination.

She knew who'd done it. Dr. Marcus Webb, her supposed collaborator, whose name appeared second on every publication, whose contributions consisted primarily of taking credit during conferences while she did the actual science. She'd seen him late last Thursday, emerging from the server room with that particular smile—the one he wore when he thought he'd been clever.

The FDA hearing was in six weeks. Six weeks to prove the data was compromised, to demonstrate that NeuraBright worked exactly as her research indicated. Six weeks to salvage everything she'd built since defending her dissertation at Princeton.

Her eyes drifted to the locked pharmaceutical refrigerator in the corner, its digital temperature readout glowing a steady 4°C. Inside, carefully catalogued and labeled, sat forty-two doses of NeuraBright—the real compound, the one that actually worked. The one she'd tested on rats, on primates, on everything except human subjects because the FDA approval pipeline moved with geological patience.

The one that could prove, definitively, that her research was sound.

If she used herself as a test subject.

The thought had been circling her mind for the past three hours, ever since she'd discovered the sabotage. A documented self-trial with daily cognitive assessments, neuroimaging, the full battery of tests she'd already designed for the Phase II clinical trials. Video documentation. Timestamped, blockchain-verified data that even Webb's manipulation couldn't touch.

Legally precarious. Ethically questionable. Professionally suicidal if it went wrong.

But she'd designed the compound. She knew its mechanism of action intimately—targeted enhancement of dendritic spine density in the prefrontal cortex, upregulation of BDNF production, optimized synaptic pruning. She'd been conservative in her dosing calculations, built in safety margins that pharmaceutical companies would consider excessive.

And she was out of options.

Ursula returned to her desk, fingers flying across the keyboard as she pulled up the self-experimentation protocols. Burton, the anesthesiologist who'd tested his cocaine research on himself. Haldane, who'd nearly killed himself proving decompression sickness theories. A long, questionable tradition of scientists using their own bodies as laboratories.

The institutional review board would never approve it. Which meant she'd need to file the paperwork after the fact, document it as an emergency measure to preserve research integrity.

Her hands were steadier now, purpose replacing panic. She drafted the protocol with clinical precision: daily subcutaneous injections, 2.3 milligrams of NeuraBright, administered at 0800 hours for a duration of six weeks. Cognitive baseline testing every seventy-two hours using the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery. Weekly MRI scans to document neurological changes. Blood work to monitor for adverse effects.

Airtight. Defensible. Scientific.

She hit save, the document timestamp reading 12:34 AM.

In the corner, the pharmaceutical refrigerator hummed. Ursula stood, crossed the lab, pressed her thumb to the biometric lock. The seal broke with a soft hiss of temperature-equalized air.

Inside, the doses waited in their neat rows. But something was wrong. The labels were slightly different—the font not quite matching her careful handwriting. She pulled one vial out, held it up to the light. The compound inside was the correct amber color, the volume precisely measured.

But the label on the box behind read "X-17-Modified" in small print she almost missed.

Her stomach dropped. X-17 was Marcus's project. A feminization compound for gender transition therapy, designed to work in conjunction with hormone treatments. She'd reviewed his research proposals, remembered his excitement about its neural remodeling properties.

This had to be a mislabeling error. A storage mistake. Webb was vindictive, but he wasn't a monster. He wouldn't—

The lab door's magnetic lock clicked. Ursula spun, the vial still in her hand, as Marcus Webb himself entered, briefcase in hand, his expression carefully neutral.

"Working late, Ursula?" His voice was pleasant. Poisonously pleasant. "I heard about your little FDA problem. Such a shame about those results."

Their eyes met across the sterile space. In that moment, she saw it—the calculation, the satisfaction, the absolute certainty that he'd already won.

"I'm fixing it," she said, her voice ice. "I'm starting a self-trial. Tomorrow."

Something flickered in his expression. Surprise? Concern?

"Bold move," he said, and smiled. "Very bold."

He left. The door locked behind him with a magnetic thunk that sounded like a cell door closing.

Ursula stood in the empty lab, the vial heavy in her palm, and felt the first whisper of doubt.

But she was out of time. Out of choices.

Tomorrow, she'd begin.

### Chapter 2: The Threshold

The syringe felt heavier than it should. Ursula held it up to the fluorescent light at precisely 0800 hours, watching the amber liquid catch and refract, a tiny sun trapped in glass and steel. The lab was empty—she'd made sure of it, arriving an hour before anyone else, when the building still held that peculiar morning silence of a place designed never to be quiet.

She'd already completed her baseline cognitive testing. The Cambridge battery had taken ninety minutes, her scores clustering exactly where she expected: 98th percentile for spatial working memory, 96th for pattern recognition, 99th for verbal reasoning. The numbers glowed on her tablet screen, a monument to everything she was about to risk.

The injection site on her abdomen was prepped, a small circle of skin swabbed rust-orange with betadine. She'd chosen subcutaneous administration—slower absorption than intravenous, safer, more controlled. The needle was insulin-gauge, thin enough that it barely registered as she pinched a fold of skin and slid it beneath the surface.

She pressed the plunger.

The compound entered her body with a sensation like cold honey spreading beneath her skin. She'd expected burning, discomfort—most subcutaneous injections produced at least minor irritation. But this was different. Almost pleasant. A spreading coolness that radiated from the injection site, crawling across her abdomen, ascending toward her ribcage.

Ursula withdrew the needle, applied pressure with a gauze pad, documented the time and dosage in her research log. Her handwriting was steady, precise. She photographed the injection site with her phone, the timestamp and date burned into the corner of the image.

Everything by the book. Everything documented.

The coolness continued spreading. Into her chest now, branching like frost patterns on winter glass. She became aware of her heartbeat, strong and steady, perhaps slightly elevated but well within normal parameters. Her breathing remained easy, controlled.

No adverse reactions. No immediate effects.

She waited fifteen minutes, monitoring her vitals with the lab's equipment. Blood pressure normal. Oxygen saturation 98%. Temperature holding steady at 98.4°F.

The fog hit at minute seventeen.

Not unpleasant. Not even unwelcome. A softening at the edges of her thoughts, as if someone had taken the sharp corners of her consciousness and gently rounded them. The anxiety that had been her constant companion for weeks—the tight fist in her chest, the racing calculations of professional doom—loosened its grip.

Ursula blinked, shook her head. This wasn't supposed to be a sedative. NeuraBright's mechanism of action focused on dendritic spine formation, on enhancing neural connectivity, not on this... this cotton-wrapped sensation.

She reached for her tablet, pulled up the cognitive testing app. Ran a quick pattern recognition module.

The shapes swam slightly before resolving. She completed the test, but her reaction time was 340 milliseconds slower than baseline. Her accuracy rate dropped from 98% to 91%.

Wrong direction entirely.

Ursula's pulse quickened. She navigated to her research files, pulled up the compound specifications for NeuraBright. But her eyes kept catching on irrelevant details—the pink border of a sticky note on her monitor, the shine of her recently manicured nails against the tablet's glass surface. When had she gotten her nails done? Thursday? They looked good. Really good. The pale pink polish caught the light in a way that seemed almost—

She forced her attention back to the screen. Scrolled through the molecular structure, the mechanism of action, the projected effects.

Nothing about cognitive softening. Nothing about attention drift.

The terrible understanding began as a cold point between her shoulder blades.

She stood too quickly, the lab stool scraping against linoleum, and crossed to the pharmaceutical refrigerator. Pulled out the box she'd taken yesterday's dose from. Read the label carefully, fighting against the persistent urge to check her reflection in the glass door.

"X-17-Modified. For investigational use only. Project Prometheus—Phase III."

Prometheus. Not her project. Webb's project.

Her hands were shaking now as she pulled up the server, navigated to the restricted research files. Typed in her credentials. The system accepted them—Webb hadn't locked her out yet, too confident in his sabotage.

The file for Project Prometheus was massive. Hundreds of pages of research documentation, trial data, projected outcomes. She opened the executive summary, her eyes racing across text that seemed to shimmer slightly at the edges.

*X-17-Modified represents a revolutionary approach to neural feminization, combining traditional hormone therapy with targeted neuroplasticity agents. The compound induces carefully calibrated reduction in abstract reasoning capacity while enhancing focus on personal appearance, social approval, and traditionally feminine behavioral patterns.*

No. No.

*Phase III trials will focus on comprehensive cognitive reshaping. Subjects will undergo progressive restructuring of identity, values, and self-concept. Brain imaging shows consistent atrophy in prefrontal cortex regions associated with complex reasoning, with corresponding hypertrophy in visual processing centers oriented toward self-image monitoring.*

The words blurred. Ursula gripped the desk edge, her breathing shallow.

*Optimal outcomes designated as "complete feminization"—subjects display enhanced physical femininity, reduced intellectual complexity, and restructured value systems centered on appearance, consumption, and male attention.*

She'd injected herself with a compound designed to make her stupid. To make her vapid. To transform her into something that cared about nail polish and reflections instead of research and reason.

And she'd signed the self-trial consent form. Documented everything. Created an airtight legal framework that bound her to six weeks of daily injections.

Six weeks of becoming someone who couldn't even understand what she'd lost.

Ursula's gaze drifted again to her reflection in the dark monitor screen. Even through the panic, some new part of her noticed how harsh the fluorescent lighting was on her skin, how she should really do something about her hair, maybe add some highlights, some softness, some—

She closed her eyes. Breathed.

When she opened them, the lab felt different. Colder. Smaller.

The syringe lay on the counter, empty, evidence of a threshold already crossed.

### Chapter 3: The First Mark

The consultation room at Prometheus Medical Solutions occupied the building's third floor—a space Ursula had never visited despite three years working in the labs below. Cream-colored walls. Photographs of smiling people who looked vaguely familiar, like stock photos that had achieved sentience. A receptionist with geometric blonde highlights and lips plumped to the edge of caricature who'd greeted her by name.

"Dr. Graves! We've been expecting you. Dr. Webb said you'd be coming in for your first procedure today."

The words had arrived through the cotton-wrapped fog that seemed to thicken with each passing hour. Procedure. Not treatment. Not consultation. As if it were already decided, already scheduled, already inevitable.

Ursula had checked her email on the walk over. Found the appointment confirmation she didn't remember making, sent from her own account at 1:47 AM. After she'd left the lab. After she'd discovered what X-17 actually did.

She'd tried to delete it. Tried to cancel. But her fingers kept hesitating on the keyboard, distracted by other thoughts. Wondering if the receptionist's lip filler was too much or just right. Noticing how the morning sun made the pink logo on the building's facade absolutely glow. Finding herself on the elevator ascending instead of descending, her body moving toward something her mind couldn't quite grasp the shape of.

"Dr. Reeves will see you now."

The procedure room looked more like a medical spa than a clinical facility. Soft lighting. A leather chair that reclined to angles suggesting comfort rather than examination. Equipment she recognized—medical-grade, expensive—arranged with careful aesthetic consideration.

Dr. Reeves was younger than she expected, dark hair pulled into a neat bun, wearing scrubs in a shade of dusty rose that seemed almost designed to be non-threatening. Her smile was professional, warm, touched with something that might have been sympathy.

"Ursula. I'm so glad you're here." She gestured to the chair. "Please, make yourself comfortable. We'll start with a consultation, discuss what you're hoping to achieve, and then proceed with the first treatment if you feel ready."

"I didn't make this appointment." The words came out softer than Ursula intended, less like an accusation and more like a question.

"Yes, you did. At 1:47 AM. You indicated you wanted to begin the full protocol." Dr. Reeves pulled up a tablet, showed her the form. Her signature at the bottom, or something very much like it. "You specified that you wanted to start with lip augmentation. A conservative approach—very wise for the first procedure."

Lip augmentation. The words should have triggered alarm, rejection, immediate departure. Instead, Ursula found herself touching her own lips, feeling their thinness, their inadequacy. They'd never bothered her before. She'd never given them thought beyond their functional role in speech, in eating, in the occasional smile.

But now—now she could see how they disappeared in photographs, how they created an asymmetry in her face, how they marked her as someone who'd prioritized other things over beauty.

"I don't—" She started to protest, but Dr. Reeves was already standing, already moving with practiced efficiency.

"Completely normal to feel nervous. This is a big step. But I promise, the results are going to make you so happy. You'll look at yourself and finally see what you've always deserved to see."

The words wrapped around Ursula's resistance like silk, smothering it gently. She let Dr. Reeves guide her into the chair, let the leather embrace her body as it reclined. The ceiling above featured a backlit panel showing clouds in an impossibly blue sky. Peaceful. Designed for distraction.

"We'll start with a topical anesthetic. You'll feel some pressure during the injection, but no pain. The swelling will be minimal—most patients are presentable within forty-eight hours."

Cool gel spread across Ursula's lips, numbing them quickly. She tried to speak, to say she'd changed her mind, to stand and leave, but her lips were already thick and clumsy, the words trapped behind tingling flesh.

Dr. Reeves filled the syringe from a small vial. Not the same amber color as X-17. This was clear, viscous, hyaluronic acid probably, standard filler, nothing experimental.

"Deep breath for me."

The needle's entry was pressure more than pain—a firm, focused sensation at her upper lip, slightly left of center. Dr. Reeves's other hand held Ursula's face steady, fingers cool and professional against her chin. The filler entered her tissue with a feeling like clay being pressed into a mold, reshaping, expanding, filling spaces she hadn't known were empty.

Another injection. Then another. Each one building on the last, creating volume, creating fullness, creating something that felt foreign and right simultaneously.

Ursula's hands gripped the chair's armrests. Not from pain—the anesthetic worked perfectly. But from the sensation of herself changing, her body being modified, her face becoming something other than what genetics had provided.

It should have horrified her. Should have triggered every instinct to flee.

Instead, she felt something that might have been anticipation.

"Almost done," Dr. Reeves murmured, working now on the lower lip, creating symmetry, creating balance. "You're doing beautifully."

The final injection was at the center of her lower lip, right where it needed fullness most. Ursula felt the subtle shift in her face's geometry, the way the added volume changed the way her skin sat on her skull.

"All finished. Let's take a look."

Dr. Reeves held up a mirror. Through the swelling and the shine of post-procedure inflammation, Ursula saw her new lips. Plump. Prominent. Decidedly feminine in a way her natural mouth had never been.

They looked good. That was the terrible truth. They looked really, really good.

"We'll see you back in two weeks for the next stage," Dr. Reeves said, already making notes on her tablet. "Dr. Webb wants to maintain a steady progression. Keep them moisturized, no strenuous exercise for forty-eight hours."

Ursula touched her new lips carefully, feeling their strange weight. In the mirror, she looked like someone in the process of becoming. Not yet transformed, but no longer entirely herself.

She should have been planning how to reverse this. How to stop this.

Instead, she was wondering what procedure came next.

### Chapter 4: The Escalation

The mirror in Ursula's apartment bathroom had become a problem.

She stood before it at 6:23 AM, already thirteen minutes behind her usual schedule, but unable to pull herself away from the examination of her new lips. Three days post-procedure. The swelling had subsided enough to reveal the final shape—fuller, softer, utterly distracting. She'd applied balm four times already this morning, mesmerized by the glide of product across plumped flesh.

Her phone buzzed. Reminder: Injection protocol, 0800 hours.

Right. The second dose.

The resistance that should have formed over the past seventy-two hours never materialized. She'd spent Tuesday evening researching X-17's mechanisms, pulling up Webb's documentation, reading with growing horror about the progressive neural restructuring. She'd made notes—detailed, clinical observations about the compound's effects on her cognition.

Then she'd gotten distracted by a YouTube video about contouring. Watched seventeen minutes of a woman explaining facial geometry and highlight placement before realizing she'd lost the thread of her research entirely.

The notes were still on her laptop, abandoned mid-sentence: *X-17 appears to redirect attentional resources toward appearance-monitoring behaviors while simultaneously reducing executive function capacity for—*

For what? She'd forgotten to finish the thought. Had instead found herself in front of the mirror again, studying her bone structure, wondering if her cheekbones could be enhanced, if her nose was too prominent, if her jaw was too square.

Thoughts that had never existed before now arrived with increasing frequency.

Ursula forced herself away from the mirror, into the bedroom where her work clothes hung in neat rows. Reached for her usual uniform—pencil skirt, button-down blouse, lab coat. Professional. Serious. The clothing of someone who commanded respect through competence.

Her hand hesitated on the hanger.

The skirt looked so... severe. The blouse was a color that could only be described as "institutional beige." When had she started dressing like someone who'd given up? Like someone who didn't care how she looked?

In the back of her closet, pushed behind winter coats and forgotten formal wear, she found a dress she didn't quite remember buying. Pink—not hot pink, not quite, but something softer. Blush, maybe. With a fitted bodice and a skirt that would hit mid-thigh. The fabric had a slight sheen to it, caught light in a way that seemed almost to glow.

She should wear the usual outfit. Should maintain her professional appearance.

But her new lips would look so good with this dress. The color would complement them perfectly, draw attention to the enhancement, make people notice what she'd improved.

The rationalization formed so smoothly she barely recognized it as one.

Ursula put on the dress. It fit differently than she remembered—tighter across the hips, requiring adjustment. Had she gained weight? Or had the dress shrunk? She turned before the mirror, studying angles, and felt a flutter of something that might have been pleasure at the shape she presented.

Pretty. She looked pretty.

The observation should have troubled her. She'd built a career on being brilliant, not pretty. Pretty was what other women concerned themselves with, women who hadn't published in Nature, who didn't have their research cited by Pentagon analysts.

But standing in her bedroom, studying her reflection, Ursula couldn't quite remember why brilliant and pretty had to be mutually exclusive.

---

The second injection went faster than the first. Her hands were steady as she prepped the site, as she filled the syringe, as she pressed the plunger and felt that spreading coolness diffuse through her system. The fog followed within minutes, thicker this time, wrapping her thoughts in soft insulation.

She tried to run the cognitive battery. Made it through fifteen minutes before abandoning it in favor of adjusting her makeup. The testing app remained open on her tablet, unanswered questions glowing accusingly, while she experimented with a lipstick shade three tones darker than she'd ever worn before.

It looked amazing. Really, truly amazing. Her new lips were made for bold color, for attention, for—

Her phone buzzed. Text from Dr. Reeves: *Ready for your 10 AM? So excited to continue your journey!*

10 AM? Ursula checked her calendar, found an appointment she had no memory of scheduling. "Consultation - Next Phase Protocol."

She should cancel. Should spend the morning running proper baseline tests, documenting the compound's effects with scientific rigor, building evidence to stop this before it progressed further.

Instead, she reapplied her lipstick, grabbed her bag, and headed for the door.

---

The consultation room looked different in morning light. Softer, more inviting. Dr. Reeves greeted her with a smile that seemed genuinely pleased, not just professionally warm.

"Ursula! Your lips look fantastic. The shape is perfect for your face." She guided her to the chair, already pulling up imaging software on her tablet. "Today we're going to discuss the next stages. Dr. Webb has designed a comprehensive protocol tailored specifically to your transformation goals."

"I didn't specify any transformation goals." The protest emerged automatically, habit more than conviction.

"Of course you did. In your intake documentation." Dr. Reeves showed her the screen. Pages of detailed specifications, body modifications requested, outcome targets defined. At the bottom, her signature again, or something very like it. "You were very clear about wanting a complete reimagining. Very bold. I respect that."

The words on the screen swam slightly, hard to focus on through the fog. But Ursula caught phrases: *breast augmentation, 500cc*, *facial feminization*, *comprehensive aesthetic protocol*.

She should have been horrified. Should have recognized this as Webb's manipulation, as evidence of the compound rewriting her decision-making, as proof she needed to stop immediately.

Instead, she found herself studying the before-and-after photos Dr. Reeves pulled up. Women transformed from ordinary to extraordinary, from plain to plastic-perfect, from forgettable to impossible-to-ignore.

"We recommend starting with breast augmentation," Dr. Reeves continued, her voice smooth and certain. "It creates a foundation for the rest of the work. Helps you start seeing yourself differently, understanding your potential."

The imaging software showed Ursula's face and body, rendered in precise 3D. Dr. Reeves manipulated the model with practiced ease, adding volume here, reshaping there. Each modification pulled her further from the woman she was, pushed her toward something else entirely.

Something that looked happy. Confident. Undeniably, unavoidably feminine.

"We can schedule you for next week. Tuesday morning, full surgical suite, you'll be recovered enough to return to modified duties within ten days."

Ursula watched her digital self transform on the screen. Watched breasts swell, waist narrow, facial features soften into doll-like delicacy. The woman in the rendering looked nothing like a scientist. Nothing like someone who'd published seventeen papers in peer-reviewed journals.

She looked like someone who took selfies for a living. Someone who counted Instagram likes instead of research citations. Someone whose greatest accomplishment would be landing a rich boyfriend who appreciated her plastic perfection.

The revulsion she expected never came. Instead, there was only a question, small and insistent: *Would that really be so bad?*

"I'll think about it," Ursula heard herself say.

But she was already calculating recovery time, already imagining how she'd look in that pink dress with enhanced proportions, already sliding further down a slope that grew steeper with each passing hour.

Dr. Reeves smiled, made notes on her tablet, and scheduled the surgery for Tuesday at 8 AM.

Ursula signed the consent form without reading it.

### Chapter 5: The Cognitive Shift

The thought arrived incomplete: *I should be worried about—*

About what? Ursula stared at the sentence fragment in her research journal, pen hovering above paper, the rest of the thought evaporated like morning dew. Something important. Something she'd meant to document before it slipped away entirely.

Her lab coat lay across the back of her chair, forgotten. She'd removed it an hour ago because the fluorescent lights made it look dingy, yellowed, unflattering. Now she sat at her workstation in the pink dress, which had somehow become her outfit of choice, rotating her chair slightly to catch her reflection in the dark monitor screen.

The third injection had gone in at 8 AM. It was now 10:47, and she couldn't quite account for the missing time. There were browser tabs open—scientific journals she must have been reading—but when she tried to focus on the abstract of a neuroplasticity study, the words refused to cohere into meaning. They sat there, smugly academic, locked behind a door she no longer had the key for.

*The compound induces dendritic—* No, that wasn't right. *The compound produces structural modifications in—* 

Her phone buzzed. Instagram notification. Someone had liked the photo she'd posted this morning—a mirror selfie in the bathroom, lips pursed, new pink dress clinging to curves she didn't remember being quite so pronounced. Forty-three likes already. The little hearts glowed red on her screen, each one a small validation, a tiny burst of pleasure that felt better than—

Better than what? 

Better than finishing that thought about dendritic something.

Ursula refreshed the post. Forty-six likes now. She studied the image with clinical detachment that lasted approximately four seconds before dissolving into frank appreciation. She looked good. Really good. Her lips were perfect, glossy with the expensive balm she'd bought yesterday at Sephora instead of going to the library to research X-17's reversal protocols.

The library. Right. She'd meant to do that.

She opened a new tab, typed "X-17 reversal" into the search bar, and immediately got distracted by an ad for lip plumping gloss. The model in the advertisement had the most amazing pout, and Ursula clicked through to the product page, reading reviews written by women who understood that beauty required investment, required attention, required—

*Focus.*

The command came from somewhere deep, some part of her that still remembered what she'd been. A scientist. A researcher. Someone whose brain was her most valuable asset, now being systematically dismantled while she wore lip gloss and Instagram engagement.

She forced her attention back to the search results. Found a study on neuroplasticity compound reversal, clicked it, began reading. The introduction made sense—she understood the terminology, followed the logic. But by the time she reached the methodology section, her eyes were glazing over, skipping lines, finding the dense technical language utterly impenetrable.

When had scientific papers become so boring?

The thought arrived with no alarm attached, just simple observation. Scientific papers were boring. They were dry, tedious, full of jargon that seemed designed specifically to make her feel stupid and confused and like she should be doing something else instead.

Something like taking another selfie, maybe with better lighting this time, maybe with her hair down instead of pulled back in that severe bun that made her look like someone's strict librarian fantasy—

Ursula stood abruptly, walked to the lab's bathroom, and stared at herself in the fluorescent glare. Her reflection looked back with lips that belonged on someone else, in a dress that screamed rather than whispered, with an expression that flickered between confusion and something that might have been contentment.

*This is wrong. This is the compound working. This is exactly what Webb designed it to do.*

The understanding was there, crystalline and complete, for exactly five seconds. Then it began to fracture, undermined by observations that felt more true, more real, more important:

*But you look so pretty.*

*And being pretty feels good.*

*And feeling good is better than being smart, because being smart made you stressed and anxious and alone in a lab at midnight, while being pretty makes people like your photos and smile at you and—*

"No." She said it aloud, gripping the sink's edge. "No, that's not me thinking. That's the drug."

But how could she tell the difference anymore? Where did Ursula end and the compound's restructuring begin?

She pulled out her phone, opened the notes app, tried to document what was happening with clinical precision:

*Day 4. Third injection administered 0800. Cognitive effects pronounced—difficulty maintaining focus on complex material, increased attention to appearance-related stimuli, rationalization of behavioral changes as voluntary choices rather than pharmacologically-induced compulsions.*

Her fingers hesitated. The paragraph looked so serious. So clinical and cold and exactly like the kind of thing that old Ursula would write, old Ursula who didn't understand that life wasn't supposed to be all work and no play, who didn't appreciate that sometimes you had to prioritize feeling good over being good at—

She deleted the paragraph. Started over:

*OMG I look so cute today! 💕 The pink dress is literally perfect and my lips are getting so much attention. Can't wait for Tuesday's procedure—bigger boobs are gonna be amazing! Finally gonna look like the hot girl I was always meant to—*

Ursula stopped. Stared at the words she'd written.

Those weren't her thoughts. Those weren't her words. That wasn't her voice.

Except it was. It absolutely was. Because she had thought those things, had felt those things, had meant every word and emoji and casual abbreviation that would have made her cringe a week ago.

The dissonance should have been unbearable. Should have triggered complete panic.

Instead, it just made her tired. Fighting was so exhausting. Resisting was so hard. And for what? To preserve some version of herself that had been stressed and lonely and never quite satisfied, while this new version got to be happy and pretty and uncomplicated?

Her phone buzzed again. Dr. Reeves: *Reminder—pre-op appointment tomorrow at 2 PM. Make sure you're fasting after midnight! So excited for your transformation! ✨*

The emoji made Ursula smile. She added the message to her calendar, color-coded it pink, added her own emoji: 💕

Then she returned to her workstation, looked at the open scientific journals with their impenetrable walls of text, and closed every single tab.

Opened Instagram instead.

Started composing her next post—a countdown to surgery, something cute and excited, something that would get lots of likes and comments and make her feel that warm glow of validation that was so much better than the cold satisfaction of a successful experiment.

Somewhere in the back of her mind, the old Ursula screamed. But the sound was muffled, distant, increasingly easy to ignore as the new Ursula took another selfie, adjusted the filter, and hit post with perfectly manicured fingers that had never looked prettier.

The cognitive shift wasn't dramatic. It was gentle, inevitable, soft as the fog that wrapped her thoughts in cotton and made resistance feel like a choice rather than a necessity.

By the time she left the lab at 3 PM—hours earlier than she'd ever left before—she'd forgotten what she was supposed to be resisting in the first place.

### Chapter 6: The Collapse

The pre-op paperwork sat on Ursula's kitchen table at 11:34 PM, still unsigned. She'd been staring at it for forty-seven minutes, pen in hand, while some diminishing part of her consciousness staged its final rebellion.

*Consent for Bilateral Breast Augmentation with Submuscular Placement of 500cc High-Profile Silicone Implants.*

The words swam. Reformed. Swam again.

This was wrong. She knew this was wrong. Somewhere beneath the fog and the pink dress she'd worn to dinner (alone, eating salad, mostly pushing lettuce around while scrolling through cosmetic surgery Instagram accounts), beneath the careful application of makeup she'd spent an hour perfecting, beneath the voice in her head that kept whispering *pretty, pretty, you're going to be so pretty*—somewhere beneath all of that, the real Ursula was drowning.

And she was running out of strength to keep her head above water.

She'd taken the fourth injection this morning. Watched her hand move through the familiar ritual with a detachment that felt like watching a stranger operate her body. The needle sliding in. The plunger depressing. The cold spread of compound entering her tissue, entering her bloodstream, crossing the blood-brain barrier to do its work.

The fog had been instantaneous. Thicker than before. So thick she'd barely made it through morning hygiene before losing herself in the mirror for ninety minutes, studying her face, planning the next enhancements, imagining how she'd look with fuller breasts pushing against low-cut tops.

Now, late at night, some quality of darkness or silence or desperation had given her a moment of clarity. A small window where she could see what was happening with almost-complete understanding.

She was being erased. Methodically. Chemically. Irreversibly.

And she was signing up for more of it, actively choosing permanent modifications that would cement her transformation from scientist to... to what? Bimbo? Doll? Some pink-obsessed creature who existed only to be looked at, who'd traded intellectual complexity for aesthetic simplicity?

Ursula's hand trembled as she set down the pen. Reached for her laptop instead. Pulled up her research files with fingers that felt clumsy, uncertain.

The old documentation was still there. Her notes on X-17, her growing understanding of what Webb had done, the evidence she'd collected of her own cognitive decline. She read her own words from three days ago:

*The compound appears to create a positive feedback loop—reduced executive function leads to increased susceptibility to appearance-focused conditioning, which reinforces the neural pathways being enhanced at the expense of abstract reasoning centers. Subjects would become progressively less capable of resisting the transformation even if they recognized it was occurring.*

She'd written that. She'd understood the mechanism. She'd documented her own doom with clinical precision.

And she'd kept taking the injections anyway.

Why?

The question hung in the digital glow of her screen, unanswerable, because every attempt to grasp the reasoning slipped away like water through fingers. She'd meant to stop after the second dose. Meant to document everything and take it to the medical board. Meant to expose Webb's manipulation and save herself.

Instead she'd bought makeup. Scheduled surgery. Posted selfies that got likes from men whose profiles featured gym photos and women whose bios listed bust measurements.

The laptop screen dimmed toward sleep mode. Ursula's reflection emerged in the darkening glass—fuller lips, softer eyes, an expression that looked perpetually slightly confused, like someone who'd lost something but couldn't quite remember what.

She looked pretty. Even she could see it. The compound was working exactly as designed, reshaping not just her cognition but her physical presentation, her body language, the way she held herself in space. More feminine. More decorative. More—

*No. Stop. Think.*

She forced her attention back to the files. Opened the folder containing Webb's original research proposal. The one she'd reviewed two years ago when he'd pitched X-17 as a therapeutic tool for gender transition.

But there were documents here she didn't remember seeing. Subfolders labeled "Phase III Outcomes" and "Personality Restructuring Parameters" and "Project Plastique."

Her cursor hovered over Project Plastique. Clicked.

The document that opened made her stomach drop.

*Project Plastique: Complete Personality Restructuring via Sustained X-17 Administration*

*Objective: Demonstrate the compound's capacity for total cognitive remodeling in high-functioning subjects. Target: Transformation of complex, intellectually-oriented personality structures into simplified, appearance-focused constructs. Success criteria: Subject maintains physical self-care routines while losing capacity for original professional function.*

*Primary Subject: Dr. Ursula Graves, selected for baseline intelligence level, documented personality rigidity, and access to controlled substances through lab facilities.*

*Anticipated Timeline: 6 weeks to complete transformation.*

*Legal Framework: Subject's self-experimentation protocol provides liability protection. Consent obtained through compound-induced suggestibility appears voluntary on all documentation.*

The words blurred. Ursula's breathing went shallow.

She was the experiment. Not NeuraBright. Not her salvaged career. This. This transformation was the actual trial, the actual data Webb was collecting.

And she'd documented every step of it herself, creating the perfect record of a brilliant woman systematically lobotomized by her own hand.

The rage should have come. The horror. The desperate scramble to undo what had been done.

Instead, there was only a soft thought, gentle and insidious: *But you look so pretty now. And the surgery will make you even prettier. And being pretty is so much easier than being smart.*

"No." She said it aloud, gripping the laptop's edge. "No, I have to stop. I have to—"

Her phone lit up. Text from Dr. Reeves: *Can't wait to see you tomorrow! You're going to look AMAZING! Remember—nothing to eat or drink after midnight! Sweet dreams! 💕✨*

The emojis made her smile. She couldn't help it. They were cute and friendly and made her feel cared for in a way that scientific collaboration never had.

Her hand picked up the pen. Moved toward the consent form.

*This is the compound. This isn't you. You're being manipulated.*

But the voice of resistance was so faint now, so easily drowned out by the louder, happier voice that said: *Just sign it. Sign it and stop fighting and let yourself become what you were always meant to be.*

The pen touched paper. Her signature began to form—

Ursula's hand stopped. Shaking. One final surge of will, of self, of the woman she'd been.

She stood abruptly. Crossed to the bathroom. Stared at her reflection with desperate focus, trying to see past the enhanced lips and careful makeup to whoever still existed underneath.

"My name is Dr. Ursula Graves," she said to the mirror. "I have a PhD from Princeton. I've published seventeen papers. I am a scientist. I am not—I am not—"

But the woman in the mirror looked so pretty. And confused. And like she was trying very hard to remember something that didn't matter anymore.

Ursula returned to the kitchen. Picked up the pen. The consent form waited, patient and inevitable.

Her hand moved. The signature flowed across the page in loops that looked less like her usual handwriting and more like the rounded, girlish script she'd been unconsciously adopting.

*Dr. Ursula Graves* became *Ursula* became something that would soon not be either.

She set down the pen. The deed was done.

In eight hours, she'd report to surgery. In eight hours, her body would be permanently modified, reshaped, enhanced in ways that would make resistance even harder, that would cement her transformation into something decorative and diminished.

And the most terrible thing—the thing that made her want to sob or scream or both—was the flutter of anticipation in her chest. The excitement. The genuine, compound-twisted eagerness for what came next.

She'd tried to resist. She'd failed.

The old Ursula was gone. The new one was just beginning.

### Chapter 7: Metamorphosis

The anesthesia dreams were pink.

Not the soft blush of her dress, but hot pink, electric pink, the pink of carnival lights and cotton candy and Instagram filters cranked to their most artificial extreme. Ursula floated through them, consciousness fragmenting like dropped glass, each piece reflecting a different version of herself that slipped away before she could grasp which one was real.

When she woke, the pain was distant. Theoretical. The fentanyl drip saw to that, turning discomfort into something that happened to someone else, somewhere far away.

But the weight on her chest was immediate.

Dr. Reeves's face swam into focus above her, smiling that professional smile that had somehow become comforting. "Welcome back. Everything went perfectly. You're going to be so happy with the results."

Ursula tried to speak. Her mouth felt stuffed with cotton, her new lips swollen from intubation. The sound that emerged was soft, questioning, more like a confused animal than a scientist with seventeen publications.

"Don't try to talk yet. Just rest. The implants are exactly where they should be—500cc, high-profile, submuscular placement. Once the swelling goes down, you're going to look absolutely incredible."

The words penetrated slowly, fighting through layers of pharmaceutical fog. Implants. She had implants now. Foreign objects sewn into her chest, stretching her tissue, creating shapes that existed only because someone had cut her open and installed them.

She should have felt violated. Mutilated. Horrified by the permanence of what had been done while she lay unconscious and helpless.

Instead, through the pain and the drugs and the exhaustion, she felt a flicker of excitement.

They were going to look so good.

---

The recovery room became her world for six hours. White walls. Monitors beeping gentle rhythms. Her chest wrapped in compression bandages that made breathing an exercise in careful intention. Every small movement sent jolts through tissue trauma sites, reminding her that her body had been invaded, restructured, permanently altered.

But the pain medication kept the worst at bay, and between doses of dilaudid, she drifted in spaces that felt more like contentment than suffering.

They let her see at hour seven.

Dr. Reeves unwrapped the bandages with careful hands, revealing swollen, bruised flesh marked with incision sites along the inframammary folds. The implants sat high on her chest—they'd drop over the coming weeks, she explained, settle into their final position.

But even swollen, even bruised, even bandaged—

Ursula stared at her transformed chest with something approaching awe.

She had breasts. Real breasts. Large, prominent, impossible to ignore. They changed her entire silhouette, created curves where straightness had been, demanded attention in a way her body never had before.

"They're perfect," she whispered, and meant it.

Dr. Reeves helped her into a surgical bra, then a loose pink hoodie that nonetheless couldn't hide the new proportions underneath. "You'll need to take it easy for a week. No lifting, no reaching overhead. Sleep elevated. I'll see you for your follow-up on Monday."

But there was something else in Dr. Reeves's expression. Something that looked almost like pity, quickly masked by professional warmth.

"Dr. Webb wanted me to remind you—you're scheduled for your fifth injection tomorrow morning. 8 AM, your apartment. He'll be administering it personally, checking your progress."

The words should have triggered alarm. Webb, coming to her home, to personally deliver the compound that was systematically destroying who she'd been.

Instead, she just felt tired. Too tired to fight. Too tired to care. Too tired to be anything except what she was becoming.

---

Webb arrived at 8:03 AM, carrying a medical kit and an expression of poorly concealed satisfaction. Ursula answered the door in pink silk pajamas that clung to her new proportions in ways that made his gaze linger fractionally too long.

"Dr. Graves. How are we feeling?"

"Sore," she said. Her voice sounded different. Higher? Softer? Or just uncertain in ways it had never been before.

He set up on her kitchen table with practiced efficiency. The syringe. The vial of amber liquid. The alcohol swabs and gauze. She watched him prepare her fifth dose with complete understanding of what it would do and absolute inability to refuse it.

"Your progress has been remarkable," Webb said, filling the syringe with precise measurement. "The cognitive assessments show exactly the trajectory we anticipated. You're responding even better than the models predicted."

"The breast augmentation was a good choice," he continued, almost conversational. "Physical modifications accelerate the psychological restructuring. You'll find yourself adapting to the new body, and the adaptation will reinforce the personality changes. Within two weeks, you won't remember why you ever resisted."

He gestured to her abdomen. She lifted her pajama top with hands that shook slightly, exposing skin for the injection.

The needle slid in. The plunger depressed. The cold spread through her system like recognition.

And this time—this time something fundamental shifted.

The fog didn't just descend. It flooded. It drowned. It filled every space where resistance had lived with something else entirely.

*Acceptance.*

Ursula felt the old self—the scientist, the researcher, the woman who'd published in *Nature*—simply let go. Stop fighting. Stop mourning. Stop clinging to an identity that no longer fit the body she inhabited or the thoughts that now filled her head.

She was becoming something else. And fighting it was exhausting. And maybe—maybe—it wasn't worth fighting at all.

Webb withdrew the needle. Applied pressure. Watched her face with clinical interest.

"How do you feel?"

Ursula touched her new breasts carefully through the silk pajamas. Felt their weight, their presence, their absolute foreignness that was somehow becoming familiar.

"Good," she heard herself say. "I feel... really good, actually."

And she meant it.

Webb smiled. It was not a kind smile.

"Excellent. I'll see you Monday for your cognitive assessment. I think we'll find some very interesting developments in your neural plasticity markers." He packed his kit, headed for the door, then paused. "Oh, and Ursula? You should start thinking about your social media presence. Your transformation deserves documentation. The world should see what you're becoming."

The door closed. The lock clicked. Ursula stood in her pink-decorated kitchen and felt the last tethers to her old self simply... dissolve.

She crossed to the mirror. Studied her reflection with new eyes.

Fuller lips, glossy with expensive balm. Softer face, slightly swollen from crying she didn't remember. Breasts that created dramatic curves under pink silk. Body that looked feminine, decorative, designed to be observed rather than taken seriously.

She looked like someone who took selfies. Someone who cared about likes and followers. Someone whose greatest achievement would be achieving physical perfection rather than intellectual breakthrough.

She looked like a bimbo.

The word should have stung. Should have triggered shame or rage or desperate grief.

Instead, it just felt... accurate.

Ursula pulled out her phone. Opened Instagram. Started composing her first real post—not the hesitant, half-ashamed selfies from before, but something committed. Something that embraced what she was becoming.

She positioned herself in the bathroom mirror, adjusted the angle to show off her enhanced chest without being explicit, pursed her new lips, added a filter that made everything glow soft and pink.

*Day 5 of my transformation journey! 💕 Surgery went amazing—so happy with my new girls! 🙈 Can't wait to show you what comes next! Who else is working on becoming their best self?? ✨👑💖*

The caption was shallow. Vapid. Full of emojis that served no communicative purpose. Written in the breathless, over-enthusiastic tone of someone whose thoughts never went deeper than the surface.

She hit post without hesitation.

The likes started coming immediately. Strangers affirming her choices, encouraging her transformation, telling her she looked hot, amazing, perfect.

Each notification was a small burst of pleasure. Better than publishing in peer-reviewed journals. Better than conference presentations. Better than anything she'd felt as a scientist.

Ursula refreshed the post. Forty-three likes already.

She giggled—actually giggled—and started planning her next photo.

The old Ursula was gone. Drowned. Dissolved completely in pink fog and surgical enhancements and compound-twisted neural restructuring.

What remained was something simpler. Happier. Emptier.

What remained was the beginning of the Plastique Princess.

And she had absolutely no desire to go back.

### Chapter 8: Plastique

The ring light cast its perfect glow at 2:34 PM, bathing Ursula—no, not Ursula anymore, just Urs, or sometimes Princess—in the kind of flattering illumination that made her skin look absolutely flawless. She adjusted the angle of her phone, making sure the camera caught her best side (left, definitely left), and the way her hot pink crop top strained against her enhanced chest.

"Hiiii beauties!" Her voice had that breathy, upward-inflected quality that made everything sound like a question. "So, like, I'm totally getting ready for my date tonight? And I thought I'd show you guys my whole routine because you've been asking and asking and I love you all so much!"

The comments started immediately. Hearts. Fire emojis. Men saying disgusting things she'd learned to find flattering. Women asking about her lip filler, her workout routine, her secret to being so pretty.

She didn't have secrets. She didn't have thoughts deep enough to qualify as secrets anymore.

And that was, like, totally okay.

Urs reached for her makeup bag—pink, obviously, covered in rhinestones she'd applied herself—and pulled out foundation three shades lighter than her natural skin tone. The coverage was full, artificial, creating a smooth mask that erased anything resembling human imperfection.

"So first you want to, like, prime everything? Make sure it's super smooth? Because your face is literally the most important thing about you and you want it to look perfect always?"

She applied the foundation with a damp sponge, watching her reflection transform in the viewfinder. This was her real job now. Not research—god, research was so boring and hard and full of words she couldn't even understand anymore. But this? This was easy. This was fun.

This was what she was meant for.

The apartment had changed with her. Pink everywhere—throw pillows, curtains, a fuzzy rug that felt amazing under her bare feet. Her bookshelves, once packed with neuroscience textbooks and research journals, now held makeup palettes and fashion magazines and framed photos of herself looking pretty. The laptop she'd used for data analysis was permanently logged into Instagram and TikTok, tracking her metrics, showing her the numbers that mattered now.

Followers: 47,293. Engagement rate: 8.3%. Brand partnerships: 4.

She was, like, basically a successful influencer.

"Okay so now contour, which is literally so important because bone structure is everything..." She picked up a palette, began applying shadow to her cheekbones with practiced precision. This she could do. This made sense. Bone structure, highlight, shadow—simple concepts that didn't require the kind of thinking that made her head hurt.

Sometimes—not often, but sometimes—there were moments when something flickered. A word she couldn't quite grasp. A memory of being different, being more, being someone who understood complicated things. But the feeling never lasted long. It was easier to just let it go, to refocus on something simple and pleasant, like the way her new lips looked when she pouted, or the perfect arch of her eyebrows, or the way men stared at her chest when she wore low-cut tops.

Which was always. She always wore low-cut tops now.

The injections had stopped at week six. Marcus had declared the experiment a complete success. She'd signed something, documents she didn't read because reading was hard and boring, transferring her research to him, giving him credit for everything, releasing him from liability.

She'd signed with a pink pen covered in glitter. Added a heart over the 'i' in her name.

"And now highlight! This is my favorite part because it makes you look so glowy and pretty and like a literal princess!" She applied shimmer to her cheekbones, her nose, her cupid's bow. Each stroke made her look more artificial, more plastic, more like something designed for display rather than function.

Perfect.

Her phone buzzed. Text from tonight's date—Chad? Brad? She couldn't quite remember, but he had abs in his profile picture and drove a BMW, so who cared?—asking what she wanted to do tonight.

She typed back with manicured nails: *idk whatever you want! im not picky lol 💕*

And she wasn't. She wasn't picky about anything anymore. Didn't have preferences complex enough to qualify as picky. She liked pink. She liked being pretty. She liked when people looked at her and told her she was hot. She liked taking photos and getting likes and buying new makeup and clothes that made her body look amazing.

Simple things. Easy things. Things that didn't require the kind of brain she used to have.

"Okay and now lips, which is like, the most important part because lips are literally everything?" She lined, filled, glossed—creating the exaggerated pout that had become her signature. The one that made men imagine things. The one that made her look perpetually available, permanently inviting, constantly ready for attention.

Behind her, visible in the frame, her old lab coat hung on the back of the door. She'd kept it for some reason, though she couldn't remember why. Sometimes she looked at it and felt... something. Something that might have been sad, if she still had the capacity for complex emotions.

But then she'd take another selfie, and the feeling would disappear under the warm glow of validation.

"Aaaand done! Don't I look so cute?" She turned her face, examining her reflection with the deep focus she reserved exclusively for her appearance. Everything else was fuzzy, uncertain, hard to grasp. But this—this she understood completely. "Let me know in the comments what you guys think! And don't forget to follow me for more beauty content and stuff!"

She blew a kiss at the camera. Posted the video. Watched the views climb.

Somewhere in the building, probably in the lab she used to work in, Marcus was presenting the results of Project Plastique to pharmaceutical executives. Showing them the before footage—Dr. Ursula Graves, brilliant and sharp and intense—and the after. What she'd become. Proof that personality wasn't fixed, that identity was malleable, that the human mind could be restructured as easily as the body could be surgically enhanced.

She'd signed away her right to privacy. To dignity. To any claim that what had been done to her was wrong.

But she didn't care. She literally didn't have the cognitive capacity to care anymore.

Urs stood, adjusting her crop top, checking her reflection one more time. The woman in the mirror smiled back—empty-eyed, glossy-lipped, pneumatic and plastic and precisely what Webb had designed her to be.

The Plastique Princess.

No science. No research. No complicated thoughts or difficult concepts or anything resembling intellectual depth.

Just pretty. Just pink. Just mindlessly, perfectly, terminally happy in a reality that required nothing more than her reflection.

She grabbed her purse—pink, designer, purchased with money from her first brand partnership—and headed for the door. Tonight was date night. Tomorrow was a photoshoot. Next week was a consultation for cheek fillers, because her face could always be more perfect, more doll-like, more completely artificial.

The old Ursula would have mourned this. Would have screamed and fought and desperately tried to claw her way back to who she'd been.

But the old Ursula was gone. Drowned. Dissolved completely in pink fog and surgical enhancements and compound-twisted neural pathways that could never be untangled.

What remained was exactly what the experiment had promised: a brilliant mind reduced to vapid simplicity, a scientist transformed into decoration, a person successfully lobotomized into plastic perfection.

And she was, like, totally okay with that.

Actually, she was happy.

Genuinely, mindlessly, permanently happy.

The door closed behind her with a soft click. In the empty apartment, the lab coat swayed slightly on its hook—a ghost of someone who no longer existed, a memorial to a woman who'd been erased by her own carefully documented hand.

Outside, the Plastique Princess descended into her new life, smiling her empty smile, thinking her shallow thoughts, living in the eternal present tense of someone whose past had been chemically deleted and whose future held nothing but selfies and shopping and the endless, effortless maintenance of being pretty.

The experiment was complete.

The transformation was permanent.

And Dr. Ursula Graves, brilliant scientist, was nowhere to be found.
