**THEME:** "Collateral Damage"
**CORE CONCEPT:** The protagonist enters a transformative arrangement to pay off a massive, life-threatening debt (hers or a loved one's).
**THE TRAP:** The "payment" is her identity. Every missed payment results in another forced modification or "service" shift.
**KEY ELEMENT:** Desperation, grime, shadowy backrooms, the feeling of being owned.
