### Terms and Conditions

# CHAPTER ONE

The conference room smelled of leather and expensive mistakes.

Dorothy Quinn sat with her spine straight, yellow legal pad centered on the mahogany table, her Montblanc pen perpendicular to the paper's edge. Across from her, three attorneys from Elysian Heights' legal team maintained the practiced neutrality of men who billed seven hundred dollars an hour to look bored.

"Two million," she said. Not a question. A confirmation for the record she was building in her mind, the one that would become testimony if they tried to weasel out later.

"Correct." The lead counsel—Harrison something, silver-haired and tan in that way that suggested either excellent genetics or a standing appointment at a dermatologist—slid the settlement agreement across the table. "Plus the NDA provisions, naturally."

Dorothy's fingers didn't quite touch the document. Not yet. She'd learned that patience in these moments paid dividends. Let them wonder if she'd balk. Let them sweat over whether their carefully constructed offer would hold.

She'd spent eight months building the case against Elysian Heights. What had started as a favor for a former law school roommate—*just look at this contract, Dot, something feels wrong*—had metastasized into a full investigation. Predatory lending practices disguised as wellness programs. Equity agreements that somehow always resulted in residents signing over their assets. Six witnesses willing to testify, though three had recanted in ways that made her teeth ache with suspicion.

But she didn't need witnesses anymore.

"The wellness integration program," Dorothy said, tapping item seven with her pen. "Define the parameters."

Harrison's smile could have sold toothpaste. "Standard protocol for settlement participants. Sixty days residency at our flagship community in Malibu. Non-negotiable, I'm afraid—it's how we ensure compliance with the NDA. You experience firsthand that our methods are sound, you see happy residents, we have assurance you won't continue making unfounded accusations to the press."

"A corporate spa vacation." Dorothy kept her voice flat. "To prove you're not a cult."

"To prove we're a legitimate wellness community, Ms. Quinn. Surely sixty days of organic meals and ocean views is a small price for two million dollars." He leaned back, and his chair probably cost more than her first car. "You've been working, what, ninety-hour weeks on this case? Consider it a working vacation. Recharge. Reflect."

Dorothy read ahead, her eyes tracking through the dense paragraphs with the speed of someone who'd spent a decade translating legalese. The wellness program requirements were maddeningly vague—participation in "community wellness activities," adherence to "scientifically optimized nutrition protocols," something about biometric monitoring for "enhanced personal health outcomes."

Corporate nonsense. The kind of Silicon Valley mysticism that rich people paid for because they'd run out of other ways to feel special.

Her apartment lease was up in three weeks. Her student loans would vanish with the first million. The second million would go into index funds, maybe a down payment on something that didn't have paper-thin walls and a radiator that clanked like a prisoner trying to signal for help.

She could quit Hartwell & Associates. Could stop defending pharmaceutical companies and banks. Could write that novel she'd been outlining in stolen moments on the subway.

Sixty days. Two months of yoga and smoothies and whatever other performance they needed her to sit through while they protected their reputation.

"I want it in writing that I maintain full access to outside counsel during the residency period." Dorothy pulled her laptop from her bag, already drafting the addendum. "And that I can terminate participation if medical concerns arise, without forfeiting the settlement."

"Medical concerns?"

"I'm not ingesting anything experimental. No unlicensed supplements, no 'proprietary blends' that turn out to be horse tranquilizers." She fixed Harrison with the look that had made opposing counsel request continuances. "I want quarterly bloodwork from an independent lab of my choosing."

They huddled. Whispered. One of the junior associates pulled out a phone, presumably texting someone higher up the food chain.

Finally: "Acceptable. We'll incorporate your addendum."

Too easy. The thought flickered through Dorothy's mind like a shadow across a sundial, there and gone. But she'd lawyered the hell out of this contract. She'd built in exits and protections and tripwires that would trigger breach notifications to three separate law firms if Elysian Heights stepped out of line.

She signed on page forty-seven. Initialed the NDA. Watched them countersign with the efficiency of men who did this often enough to have the choreography memorized.

"Welcome to Elysian Heights, Ms. Quinn." Harrison stood, extended his hand. His palm was dry and cool. "A car will collect you Monday morning. Pack light—we provide everything you'll need."

"I'm sure you do," Dorothy said.

—

The black Mercedes arrived at 6 AM with California plates and windows tinted dark enough to be illegal in thirty states. The driver was young, blonde, uniformed in white linen that looked like it would wrinkle if she thought too hard. She smiled with every tooth visible.

"Morning! I'm Brittany! I'm, like, *so* excited you're joining our community family!"

Dorothy loaded her suitcase into the trunk herself, ignoring Brittany's attempt to help. She'd packed her laptop, three legal texts, enough professional clothes for sixty days, and a burner phone her paralegal had acquired through methods Dorothy had decided not to examine too closely.

The drive north along the Pacific Coast Highway should have been beautiful. Morning light turning the ocean copper and gold, cliffs dropping away to beaches that looked carved from postcards. But Dorothy was reading the final contract version on her tablet, checking for last-minute alterations, finding none but unable to shake the feeling that she'd missed something.

"We're, like, totally going to be best friends," Brittany said, glancing at her in the rearview mirror. "Everyone at Elysian is *so* close. It's like, you know when you meet someone and you just *know* they're going to change your life?"

"Mm," Dorothy said, not looking up.

The gates appeared suddenly—white stone, twelve feet high, topped with what she initially thought were decorative flourishes before realizing they were cameras. The metal placard read ELYSIAN HEIGHTS in letters that managed to be both elegant and vaguely threatening.

Beyond the gates: pastel architecture that looked like someone had tried to build heaven from a mood board. Pink and white buildings with clean lines and too many windows. Gardens so precisely maintained they seemed artificial. And people—dozens of them—in matching activewear, all smiling, all moving through morning yoga poses on manicured lawns with the synchronized precision of a disturbing dance troupe.

The Mercedes stopped in front of the main building. Brittany turned, and her smile had somehow gotten wider.

"Ready for your transformation?"

Dorothy stepped out into the sunshine. The air smelled of jasmine and something else, something sweet and chemical she couldn't quite place. Around her, the yoga participants moved together, breathed together, smiled with identical expressions of vacant contentment.

From a second-story window, someone watched her. A woman with platinum hair and dead eyes, wearing pink that hurt to look at directly.

The woman waved.

Dorothy picked up her suitcase and walked through the doors.

### The Sweetness of Surrender

# CHAPTER TWO

The intake coordinator had perfect teeth and a clipboard she consulted like scripture.

"Dorothy Quinn, twenty-eight, attorney, Chicago." She looked up with eyes the color of bottled water. "You'll be in Harmony House, west wing. We've prepared your welcome package."

The lobby reminded Dorothy of a boutique hotel designed by someone who'd never experienced an actual emotion. Everything white or pale pink or that particular shade of beige that suggested wealth without saying it directly. Orchids in precise arrangements. A fountain that burbled with calculated serenity. 

"I'd like to review the daily schedule," Dorothy said. "And get the contact information for the medical staff supervising the wellness program."

"Oh, everything's in your welcome package! Plus, Harmony House has the *best* community atmosphere. You're going to make so many friends." The coordinator—her name tag read JESSICA in lowercase letters that seemed like an affectation—stood with the assumption that Dorothy would follow. "Let's get you settled!"

Dorothy's room was twice the size of her Chicago apartment and decorated like an Instagram influencer's wet dream. White furniture with gold accents. A bed that could sleep four, covered in pink pillows that served no structural purpose. Floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking gardens where those same yoga practitioners still moved in their unsettling synchronization.

The welcome package sat on the desk in a pink box tied with white ribbon.

"So, our morning session starts at seven with sunrise yoga," Jessica said, her voice performing enthusiasm. "Then breakfast in the community dining room—Chef Marcus makes these *amazing* açai bowls that are literally to die for. After that, you'll meet with your wellness coordinator to customize your program, and then free time until the afternoon enrichment session."

Dorothy opened the box. Inside: a pale pink yoga outfit that looked expensive and uncomfortable. A water bottle made of some sustainable material that probably cost sixty dollars. A leather-bound journal with GRATITUDE embossed on the cover. Organic skincare products in frosted glass bottles. And a wristband, rose gold and pink, slim enough to be jewelry, heavy enough to feel significant.

"What's this?" She held up the wristband.

"Oh my god, you're going to *love* the Harmony Band! It tracks your biometrics—heart rate, sleep patterns, hydration levels—and syncs with our wellness app to optimize your personal health journey. Everyone wears one." Jessica's enthusiasm had the quality of a recording played at slightly the wrong speed. "It helps us make sure you're getting the most out of your experience."

"I didn't agree to constant biometric monitoring."

"It's part of the wellness integration program. See, section seven, subsection C." Jessica pulled out her tablet, showed Dorothy the contract paragraph she'd read too quickly because it had been buried in medical jargon. Voluntary biometric monitoring to ensure resident safety and program efficacy. "But honestly, you'll forget you're wearing it after, like, a day. Mine's given me *such* good insights into my sleep quality."

Dorothy turned the band over. No visible charging port. No obvious way to remove it—the clasp was seamless, probably magnetic. She thought about refusing, then remembered: sixty days. Two million dollars. Pick your battles.

She fastened it around her left wrist. The metal was cool, then warm, then temperature-neutral so quickly she wondered if she'd imagined the transition. A small LED blinked green once, then went dark.

"Perfect! Okay, so dinner's at six, and then we have optional evening meditation in the reflection garden, but tonight's your first night so you can totally just relax and settle in. Oh, and your welcome smoothie's in the mini-fridge—it's like, our signature blend, super nutrient-dense. You should drink it within the hour for maximum bioavailability."

Jessica left in a cloud of expensive perfume, and Dorothy was alone with her perfect room and her growing unease.

She checked her phone. Full signal. Pulled up her email, sent a message to her paralegal: *Arrived. Contact confirmed. Will check in every 48 hours.* Then she photographed the wristband from three angles and uploaded the images to her encrypted cloud storage.

The mini-fridge hummed in the corner. Dorothy opened it, found the smoothie in a glass bottle, pale pink and viscous. A small card leaned against it: *Welcome to Elysian Heights! This proprietary blend contains adaptogens, nootropics, and essential vitamins to support your transformation journey. Best consumed cold.*

She held it up to the light. Couldn't see anything obviously wrong—no sediment, no suspicious particles. But then, that was the point, wasn't it? If they were dosing residents with something, they'd have perfected the delivery method years ago.

Dorothy set it back in the fridge. She'd dump it down the sink after Jessica's footsteps faded completely.

But the wristband vibrated. Once. Gentle. Almost apologetic.

She looked down. The LED had turned amber. As she watched, text scrolled across a display she hadn't realized existed: *HYDRATION REMINDER. PLEASE CONSUME YOUR WELLNESS SMOOTHIE.*

"You have got to be kidding me."

She turned to the sink, bottle in hand. The wristband vibrated again, more insistent. The amber light pulsed. And then—

Pain.

Not severe. More like a warning. A sharp tightness around her wrist, pressure building, accompanied by a high-pitched tone she felt more than heard. Her cortisol spiking, probably, triggering whatever corrective protocol they'd built into this thing.

Dorothy's analytical mind catalogued the sensation even as her hand trembled: aversive conditioning, immediate negative reinforcement, probably not enough to cause damage but definitely enough to ensure compliance through operant learning.

The wristband wanted her to drink the smoothie.

She could refuse. Could rip the band off, probably set off alarms, definitely trigger breach notifications. Could call her lawyer, void the settlement, walk away with nothing but her dignity and her student loans.

Or she could drink one smoothie. Get baseline bloodwork tomorrow from the independent lab she'd written into the contract. Document everything. Play the game for sixty days and leave with enough money to never play another game again.

The pressure increased. The tone got louder. Her wrist felt like it was caught in a tightening vice.

Dorothy opened the bottle and drank.

It tasted like strawberries and cream and something floral she couldn't identify. Went down easy, almost too easy, coating her throat with sweetness. She finished it in four long swallows and set the empty bottle on the counter.

The wristband's light turned green. The pressure released. The tone stopped.

"Good girl," she muttered, mocking the device, mocking herself.

She didn't feel different. Not immediately. Just tired from the early morning, from the drive, from the constant low-grade adrenaline of being in enemy territory wearing a smile.

Dorothy changed into the pajamas she'd brought from home—rational flannel, purchased from a reasonable store—and climbed into the ridiculous bed. Outside, the sun was setting over the Pacific, painting everything gold and rose and orange. The yoga practitioners had dispersed. The gardens were empty.

Except for that woman in the window. Still there. Still watching. Still wearing that shade of pink that seemed somehow louder than it should be.

Dorothy closed the blackout curtains and tried to ignore how good the pillows smelled. Like vanilla and something else. Something sweet.

Sleep came faster than it should have, pulled her down like an undertow, and in the space between waking and dreaming she heard music. Soft. Rhythmic. A woman's voice whispering words she couldn't quite catch, affirmations or instructions or maybe both, looping and layering until they became a lullaby for the rational mind.

*Let go. It's easier. You're safe here. Pretty girls don't worry. Smart girls get tired. Let go. Let go. Let—*

She tried to surface, to reject the suggestion, but her thoughts moved like honey now, slow and thick and golden. The fog settled over her consciousness with the weight of inevitability, and Dorothy Quinn—who'd graduated summa cum laude, who'd built cases that made partners weep, who'd signed her life away for two million dollars and sixty days—let herself sink into the manufactured dark.

In the morning, she wouldn't remember the music.

But her first thought, surfacing into consciousness with the sunrise, would be about how pretty the pink yoga outfit looked hanging in her closet.

And she wouldn't quite remember why that should worry her.

---

### Compliance Architecture

# CHAPTER THREE

Dorothy woke to music she couldn't remember hearing.

The sun filtered through the curtains in that specific California way that felt less like morning and more like a directive. She lay in the excessive bed, staring at the ceiling, trying to reconstruct the previous evening. She'd drunk the smoothie. She'd gone to bed. She'd slept.

Hadn't she?

The gap between lying down and waking up felt wider than it should, as if someone had removed hours from her memory and replaced them with cotton batting. But her phone showed seven hours had passed. Her Fitbit—her personal one, not the wristband—confirmed sleep data that looked normal. REM cycles. Deep sleep. Everything fine.

Except she couldn't shake the sensation of having heard someone talking to her all night.

The wristband pulsed green twice. Text scrolled: GOOD MORNING, DOROTHY. SUNRISE YOGA BEGINS IN 30 MINUTES. PLEASE DRESS AND PROCEED TO THE EAST GARDEN.

She stared at it. The command sat on her skin in LED letters, and she felt something in her chest tighten—not quite anxiety, more like anticipation. The urge to comply arrived before her conscious objection could form.

*I should refuse,* she thought. *I should stay in bed just to prove I can.*

But the wristband had already gone amber. The pressure started building. And beneath it, a new sensation: a creeping discomfort that felt like wrongness, like she was disappointing someone important by even considering disobedience.

Dorothy was in the pink yoga outfit before she'd consciously decided to comply.

The realization stopped her halfway to the door. She looked down at herself—pale pink leggings that hugged curves she normally hid under structured wool, a matching sports bra that left her midriff exposed, her dark hair loose around her shoulders instead of pulled into its usual severe bun.

*When did I change?*

The memory was there, but distant, like watching someone else move through the motions. She'd showered. Applied the moisturizer from the welcome package because it had been sitting right there and her skin had felt dry. Let her hair air-dry because the blow-dryer seemed like too much effort.

Small choices. Reasonable choices. Nothing to worry about.

The wristband pulsed green, approving. The pressure vanished. Dorothy felt something uncomfortably close to relief.

—

The East Garden held thirty women in various stages of transformation.

Dorothy recognized the stages immediately, though she couldn't have said how. At the front, closest to the instructor's platform, were the ones who'd been here longest. Platinum blonde, uniformly tan, wearing pink that seemed to be their skin tone now. They moved through the poses with liquid grace and vacant smiles, their bodies optimized and their eyes glass.

In the middle rows: women transitioning. Hair lightening, faces smoothing, that sharp intelligence starting to diffuse into something softer. They smiled too much, laughed at nothing, but occasionally Dorothy caught one of them looking confused, as if they'd surfaced from deep water and couldn't remember how they'd gotten wet.

And in the back: new arrivals. Brunettes, redheads, women still wearing the wrong kind of awareness in their expressions. Women who hadn't learned yet that thinking too hard made the wristband hurt.

Dorothy took a spot in the back row.

The instructor appeared from nowhere, or maybe she'd been there the whole time and Dorothy had just failed to notice. She wore white, her hair a shade of blonde that seemed to generate its own light, her body the kind of perfect that suggested either exceptional genetics or exceptional surgery.

"Good morning, beautiful souls." Her voice was honey and silk and the vocal equivalent of the color pink. "I'm Crystal. Let's begin with intention-setting. Close your eyes. Place your hands over your heart. Feel your breath. Let go of the thinking that keeps you small."

Dorothy closed her eyes because everyone else did. Felt her breath because that was just physiological observation. But when Crystal said to let go of thinking, something in Dorothy's chest seized up.

The wristband vibrated. Not painful yet. Just a warning.

"Breathe into the resistance," Crystal said, and Dorothy wasn't sure if she was talking to the whole class or just to her. "Your mind wants to protect you, but protection feels like a cage. Freedom is in surrender. Freedom is in softness. Breathe, and let your thoughts become clouds. Drifting. Dissolving. Gone."

The breathing exercise was simple. Inhale for four counts, hold for four, exhale for four. But somewhere around the third repetition, Dorothy noticed the sound piped through hidden speakers—subliminal tones just below conscious hearing, a rhythm that matched the breathing pattern, and underneath it, voices. Women's voices. Layered. Whispering.

*Let go. Good girls listen. Thinking hurts. Pretty girls breathe. Smart girls struggle. Empty girls smile. Let go. Let go. Let—*

"No," Dorothy said. Out loud. Her eyes snapped open.

The wristband's pain arrived instantly. Not the warning pressure but actual pain, electrical and sharp, racing up her arm to her shoulder. Her cortisol had spiked—adrenaline response to the realization that she was being actively conditioned—and the device was punishing her for the physiological markers of resistance.

Crystal was in front of her somehow, moving faster than she should have been able to, her smile never wavering. "First day is always hardest. Your body's releasing so much stress. Let's try a simpler pose—child's pose. Just rest. Let the resistance go."

"I'm fine." Dorothy's voice came out strained. The pain was intensifying, her whole left side now, and black spots crowded her vision. "Just need a moment."

"Breathe, honey. Long breath. Let it out. That's good. You're doing so good."

Dorothy breathed. Had no choice but to breathe. And as oxygen filled her lungs, the pain receded. Crystal's hand was on her back, warm and steady, and her voice had gotten softer, more intimate, like a mother soothing a frightened child.

"See? Your body knows what it needs. Your mind is the only thing fighting. But minds get tired, Dorothy. Minds get confused. Your body wants to feel good. Don't you want to feel good?"

"Yes," Dorothy said, and meant it, and hated that she meant it.

"Then listen to your body. Let it lead. The poses will feel better if you stop thinking about them. Just move. Just breathe. Just be."

Crystal returned to the front of the class. The music resumed. The subliminal whispers continued their patient assault. And Dorothy moved through the poses with the rest of them, her analytical mind trying and failing to maintain distance from her compliant body.

Downward dog. Warrior one. Tree pose, which should have been impossible given her limited balance, but she held it perfectly because stopping to think about holding it would have made the wristband hurt again.

Somewhere in the middle of the session, Dorothy realized she was smiling.

Not because she was happy. But because everyone else was smiling, and matching their expressions felt easier than maintaining her own. Like her face was learning from theirs, adopting their patterns, her mirror neurons firing so insistently that resistance felt like swimming against a rip current.

By the time Crystal called them into final savasana—corpse pose, which Dorothy's mind noted with grim irony—the newest arrivals in the back row were all smiling too.

"Rest here," Crystal said. "Let your mind be quiet. Let your body be soft. You are safe. You are cared for. You are becoming exactly who you're meant to be."

Dorothy lay on her pink mat, staring at the sky, feeling the sun on her skin and the morning breeze and the inexplicable sensation that her thoughts were moving differently than they had yesterday. Slower. Simpler. Following grooves that hadn't been there before.

The smoothie, her analytical mind whispered. The subliminal audio. The wristband's conditioning. Classical manipulation of neuroplasticity, combined with negative reinforcement and peer pressure and environmental control. You're being programmed.

But the thought arrived without urgency. Observed from a distance. Like a fact about someone else.

"Beautiful work today, everyone," Crystal said. "Take your smoothies from the station before breakfast. Your bodies need the nutrition after such deep release."

The women around Dorothy stood, still smiling, and moved toward a table Dorothy hadn't noticed before. Thirty glass bottles, pale pink, precisely arranged. Each one labeled with a resident's name in flowing script.

DOROTHY QUINN, hers read.

She picked it up. The wristband pulsed approval. She drank it standing there, surrounded by women who no longer struggled, and the sweetness coated her throat and her thoughts and she couldn't quite remember what she'd been worried about.

The woman in platinum blonde from yesterday's window stood at the garden's edge, watching. When Dorothy met her eyes, the woman's smile widened. She raised her own smoothie bottle in a toast.

Dorothy found herself toasting back.

And when she lowered the bottle, empty, her reflection in its curved glass showed someone who looked like her but softer. Prettier. Less sharp around the eyes.

She tried to care about the difference.

She couldn't quite manage it.

—

Breakfast was açai bowls and kombucha and small talk that felt like chewing glass. The women at Dorothy's table—all second-week residents, their hair already lightening, their voices already developing that breathy quality—talked about Crystal's instructions, about their improving flexibility, about how much better they felt since letting go of their old stress.

"I was an architect," one said, and laughed like it was the funniest thing she'd ever heard. "Can you imagine? All those boring blueprints. I don't even know why I thought I needed to be so serious about everything."

"What do you do now?" Dorothy asked, forcing her mouth to form words.

"I'm focusing on my wellness journey. Crystal says that's the most important career any woman can have—being the best version of herself."

The others nodded, sage. Dorothy felt her own head starting to nod along and stopped herself. The wristband vibrated once, warning. Her disagreement was triggering it. Disagreement was stress. Stress was bad. Compliance was good.

The logic was so simple it felt true.

"Dorothy used to be a lawyer," someone else said—Jessica, the intake coordinator, sitting at the head of the table like a camp counselor. "Corporate law, right? That must have been so exhausting."

"It was," Dorothy said. The admission came out before she could stop it. "Ninety-hour weeks. No life. Just briefs and depositions and fighting."

"You don't have to fight anymore," Jessica said gently. "That's what Elysian Heights is for. Learning that you're enough just by being. Pretty girls don't have to prove anything."

Dorothy's mouth opened to object—to argue that intelligence mattered, that women could be more than decorative, that reducing herself to appearance-based validation was the exact kind of sexist bullshit she'd spent her career dismantling.

But the wristband was already amber. Already tightening. And beneath the table, her hand started to shake.

"I guess that's true," she heard herself say. "It's nice to just... relax."

"See?" Jessica beamed. "You're already learning. By week two, you'll be amazed at how much easier everything feels when you stop trying so hard to think about it."

The other women smiled. Dorothy smiled back. Her reflection in the polished table surface showed that same soft expression she'd seen in the bottle, and she realized with creeping horror that she was starting to forget what her old face had looked like.

The analytical one. The sharp one. The one that had been hers.

But forgetting felt like relief, and relief felt good, and good was all that mattered anymore.

—

That night, in her perfect room, Dorothy tried to write a report for her paralegal. Tried to document what was happening. But every time she formulated a critical thought—*they're drugging us, they're conditioning us, I need to leave*—the wristband's pain arrived. And after the pain came the music, subliminal and patient, filling her head with cotton.

She managed three sentences: *Daily smoothies contain unknown compounds. Wristband enforces compliance via pain. Am struggling to maintain analytical distance.*

Then she deleted them. Wrote instead: *Everything fine. Wellness program very relaxing. Will update next week.*

Sent it before she could think too hard about why she was lying.

The wristband pulsed green. Approval.

Dorothy climbed into bed and pulled the pink silk sheets up to her chin. In the morning, she'd drink her smoothie. She'd attend yoga. She'd smile at Crystal's instructions and feel her thoughts dissolve into fog and forget, gradually, what she'd been trying to resist.

But tonight, for just a few more hours, she was still Dorothy Quinn.

Mostly.

The music started as her eyes closed. The whispers returned, patient and inexorable, and this time she didn't fight them. Fighting hurt. Listening felt better.

*Good girl. Pretty girl. Let go. Let go. Let—*

She let go.

—

### The Erosion of Objection

# CHAPTER FOUR

The case law blurred.

Dorothy sat in the community library—mahogany shelves, leather chairs, windows overlooking gardens where women in pink performed their synchronized contentment—with her laptop open to Westlaw and her yellow legal pad covered in notes that made less sense every time she read them.

She was writing the report. The real one. The documentation she'd need when she got out, when she went to the state bar, when she exposed what Elysian Heights was doing to its residents. Three weeks in, and she still had enough of herself left to know she needed evidence.

But the words wouldn't cooperate.

*Respondent utilized systematic application of aversive conditioning*, she'd written, *combined with neurochemical manipulation via undisclosed compounds, resulting in measurable cognitive degradation and personality disintegration.*

She read it back. The syntax was correct. The legal terminology accurate. But something about the sentence structure felt wrong—too complex, too many clauses, her brain stumbling over words that should have been second nature.

Dorothy tried again: *They're hurting us on purpose. The smoothies have drugs. The wristband shocks you if you think wrong.*

Simpler. But also wrong. Too informal for a legal brief. And the word "wrong" kept snagging in her mind because was it wrong, really? She felt better than she had in Chicago. Slept better. Smiled more. The constant tension in her shoulders had dissolved. Her jaw no longer ached from grinding her teeth through the night.

Maybe the thinking that felt like "her" had just been stress wearing a personality.

The wristband pulsed. Not painful—she'd learned to catch the warning signs before her cortisol spiked enough to trigger punishment. Just a gentle reminder that she'd been sitting still too long. That her body needed movement, needed sunshine, needed the afternoon yoga session that started in twenty minutes.

She saved the document. Closed her laptop. And only as she stood did she realize she'd been staring at the same paragraph for forty minutes and hadn't written a single new word.

—

Crystal taught the afternoon sessions too, though Dorothy was starting to suspect Crystal never left. That she was somehow always present in the gardens, the dining hall, the reflection spaces, her white clothing and platinum hair a persistent reminder of what waited at the end of the transformation.

"Beautiful work, everyone," Crystal said as they moved through sun salutations. "I can see how much softer you're all becoming. Dorothy, your alignment is improving so much."

Dorothy felt the praise like warmth in her chest. Looked down at her body—tanner than it had been, the yoga outfit fitting differently now, her stomach flatter, her thighs somehow both smaller and more toned—and felt proud. When had she gotten proud of her body? She'd spent thirty years treating it like a vehicle for her brain, something to maintain but not celebrate.

"You're thinking again," Crystal said, suddenly beside her. "Feel your breath. Let the thoughts go."

"I'm trying." Dorothy's voice came out smaller than she intended. Like a student apologizing to a teacher. "They just keep coming back."

"Because you're still feeding them. Every time you analyze, you're watering weeds. Let them dry out. Starve them. Your garden will grow so much prettier when you stop cluttering it with thoughts that don't serve your happiness."

The metaphor was idiotic. Reducing consciousness to gardening, as if critical thinking was something to be pruned away. Dorothy opened her mouth to say so, felt the wristband's warning pressure, and closed her mouth again.

"Good girl," Crystal said. "See how much easier it is when you just listen?"

And Dorothy did see. Could feel the path of least resistance, the one where she nodded and smiled and moved through the poses without questioning them. Her body wanted that path. Her body was tired of fighting.

Only her mind resisted, and her mind was getting so much quieter.

—

The woman in platinum blonde was named Tiffany.

Or had been named something else before. Dorothy couldn't remember which was true. They were having smoothies together on the meditation deck—Dorothy's idea, or maybe Tiffany's, the origin of the plan already fuzzy—and Tiffany's laugh sounded like wind chimes in a breeze that never stopped blowing.

"You're still so serious," Tiffany said, and giggled. "Like, I can see you thinking. It's super cute but also kind of exhausting to watch."

"I'm a lawyer," Dorothy said. Then corrected: "Was a lawyer. I'm still... I mean, I'm here temporarily. For the settlement."

"Oh my god, I was a professor! Isn't that wild?" Tiffany leaned forward, her eyes bright and empty as new marbles. "I taught, like, philosophy or something? About men who were super boring and wrote boring books. I can't even remember why I thought that was important."

Dorothy felt something cold in her stomach. "You have a PhD."

"Had! Past tense!" Another giggle. "Now I have this." She gestured at herself—her perfect body, her platinum hair, her pink dress that probably cost more than Dorothy's law school textbooks. "And honestly? This is so much better. Like, who needs to think about Kant or whatever when you can just be pretty and happy and, you know, *appreciated*."

"You're not happy. You're drugged."

The words came out before Dorothy could stop them. The wristband's pain arrived instantly, electrical and sharp, racing up her arm. But worse than the pain was the look on Tiffany's face—not anger, just confusion, like Dorothy had spoken in a language she'd forgotten how to understand.

"Why would you say something mean?" Tiffany's voice was small. "I thought we were friends."

"I'm sorry." Dorothy was apologizing before she'd decided to, her hand reaching out to touch Tiffany's arm, soothing her. "I didn't mean it. You're right. You seem really happy."

"I *am* happy. Happier than I ever was when I was trying to be smart. Smart just meant lonely and stressed and like, angry all the time about stuff that didn't matter." Tiffany's smile returned, bright and terrible. "Now I matter. Like, I'm the face of Elysian Heights in all the promotional materials. I help other women see how good they could feel if they just let themselves be feminine and soft."

"You're a spokesmodel."

"I'm a *success story*." Tiffany squeezed Dorothy's hand. "And you're going to be one too. I can tell. You have such pretty bone structure under all that thinking. By week eight, you're going to be *gorgeous*."

Dorothy pulled her hand back. The wristband had gone amber—warning her that her stress response was elevating again, that disagreement was imminent. She forced her breathing to slow. Forced her expression to soften into something that might pass for agreement.

"Maybe," she said.

Tiffany beamed. "See? You're already learning. It gets easier, promise. Like, right now you're still fighting because you think your brain is who you are. But your brain is just this thing that makes you miserable. Your body, though—your body knows what it wants. And once you let it lead, everything feels so good."

She said "good" the way some people said "god," with reverence and certainty and the absolute conviction of someone who'd forgotten what doubt felt like.

Dorothy finished her smoothie. The sweetness coated her throat, and beneath it, that floral undertone she'd stopped trying to identify. It didn't matter what was in it. Knowing wouldn't change anything. She'd signed the contract. She wore the wristband. She was here for sixty days, and fighting just made everything hurt.

"Want to do face masks tonight?" Tiffany asked. "They're doing this special collagen treatment in the spa. Makes your skin so soft and glowy. We could, like, have a whole self-care evening."

Dorothy heard herself say yes. Heard herself giggle—actually giggle—when Tiffany clapped her hands in excitement. And as they walked back toward Harmony House, Dorothy caught their reflection in the glass doors.

Tiffany in pink. Dorothy in pink. Both blonde now—when had Dorothy's hair gotten so light?—both smiling, both moving with that same liquid grace.

They looked like sisters. Like twins. Like the same woman at different stages of completion.

And Dorothy felt something she hadn't expected: she felt turned on.

Not by Tiffany. By herself. By the reflection of who she was becoming. The softness of her face, the curve of her body in the yoga outfit, the way her hips swayed when she walked. She looked good. Better than good. She looked like the kind of woman men stared at, the kind of woman who didn't need to be smart because her appearance was its own currency.

The arousal came with shame, but the shame was distant. Hard to hold onto. Her body liked what it saw, and her body was getting better at overruling her mind.

"You're blushing," Tiffany said, delighted. "Are you thinking about boys? You totally are. That's so cute."

"No, I—" But she was. Was thinking about being desired, being wanted, the power in that want. Had spent thirty years dismissing her appearance as secondary to her intelligence, and now her intelligence was dissolving and her appearance was all that remained and some traitorous part of her was relieved.

Being smart was exhausting. Being pretty seemed simple.

—

The collagen face masks felt like surrender.

Dorothy lay on the spa bed with cooling gel on her face and cucumber slices on her eyes and Tiffany beside her humming something tuneless and content. The subliminal audio played through hidden speakers—she recognized it now, that pattern of whispers—but instead of fighting it, she let it wash over her. Let the affirmations soak in with the collagen.

*Pretty girls don't need to think. Smart girls are lonely. Soft girls are loved. Empty feels good. Let go. Let go. Let—*

She let go.

And in the letting go, something shifted. Her resistance had been holding her in place, keeping her locked in an identity that no longer fit. But resistance was tension, and tension was pain, and pain was the enemy of pleasure.

This—the softness, the sweetness, the sensation of her thoughts growing lighter and less important—this was pleasure. Deep and undeniable. Her body relaxed into it, and her mind, finally, stopped fighting.

"Doesn't it feel amazing?" Tiffany whispered. "When you stop trying to be someone complicated?"

"Yes," Dorothy said. Meant it. Felt it in every cell.

She was still Dorothy Quinn. Still had her memories, her history, her law degree. But those things were becoming facts about someone else. A person she used to be. A person who'd been so tense and unhappy and convinced that thinking harder would solve problems that didn't need solving.

The woman she was becoming didn't have those problems. The woman she was becoming just had to be beautiful and compliant and empty enough to hold whatever meaning Elysian Heights poured into her.

And lying there with chemicals soaking into her skin and whispers soaking into her mind, Dorothy felt the last solid piece of her analytical self begin to dissolve.

It felt like relief.

It felt like falling.

It felt, despite everything, unbearably good.

### The Breaking Point

# CHAPTER FIVE

The mirror in Dorothy's bathroom had become her enemy and her addiction.

She stood in front of it for the third time that morning, yoga outfit already on, smoothie already consumed, wristband pulsing its gentle approval. But she couldn't stop looking. Couldn't stop cataloging the changes that had accelerated over the past two weeks until her reflection felt like a stranger wearing her face.

Honey-blonde hair that fell in waves she'd never had before. Skin that seemed to glow from within, that perfect California tan that suggested health and youth and expensive maintenance. Her body—god, her body—had transformed into something from a fitness magazine. Curves in all the places men looked. Flatness where it mattered. The yoga outfit clung to her like it had been designed for this specific configuration of flesh.

She looked beautiful. Objectively, measurably beautiful.

And she couldn't remember what she used to look like underneath.

Dorothy tried to summon the old version—sharp suit, severe bun, the professional armor she'd worn like identity. But the image wouldn't cohere. Kept slipping away, replaced by this new reflection that smiled with her mouth but not her eyes.

*No.* That was wrong. She smiled with her eyes too now. Smiled all the time. Smiling felt good, and good was—

The thought fragmented. She'd been building to something, some objection or analysis, but it dissolved before reaching completion. Like a wave that breaks before touching shore.

This was happening more often. Thoughts that started with complexity and ended in cotton. Sentences she couldn't finish because the middle got lost. Yesterday she'd tried to read one of her law texts and found herself staring at the same paragraph for twenty minutes, the words recognizable but meaningless, like a language she'd once spoken but had forgotten how to translate.

The wristband pulsed. Time for morning yoga. She should go. She wanted to go. Crystal would be disappointed if she was late, and disappointing Crystal felt worse than the wristband's pain.

But something in Dorothy's chest constricted. Some last piece of resistance, compressed and hardening like coal into diamond.

*This isn't me.*

The thought arrived with the force of truth. With the clarity she'd been lacking for weeks. She wasn't this person. Wasn't this soft, pretty, empty thing that giggled at Tiffany's jokes and felt proud when men stared and measured her value by the smoothness of her skin.

She was Dorothy Quinn. Corporate lawyer. Summa cum laude. The woman who'd built a case that brought Elysian Heights to settlement. The woman who'd been smart enough to see the trap and stupid enough to think she could walk through it unharmed.

*I have to leave.*

The decision crystallized. Sixty days or not, settlement or not—she had to get out. Had to get somewhere with independent doctors and deprogramming specialists and people who could reverse whatever they'd done to her brain.

Dorothy grabbed her phone. Her hands shook as she pulled up her paralegal's contact, typed with the urgency of someone who knew the window was closing: *Need extraction. Not safe. Can't think clearly. Send help to—*

The wristband went from green to red in an instant.

Pain exploded up her arm—not the warning pressure, not even the corrective shock, but something worse. Felt like electricity and fire and every nerve ending screaming simultaneously. Dorothy dropped the phone, heard it clatter against tile, and collapsed to her knees with a sound she'd never made before.

Her vision whited out. The pain was comprehensive, total, erasing everything except the immediate animal need to make it stop.

"Please," she gasped. To the wristband, to whoever was monitoring, to the building itself. "Please stop please stop please—"

The door opened. Crystal stood there in her white uniform, her expression serene and sad, like a mother watching a child throw a tantrum.

"Oh, Dorothy." She knelt down, touched Dorothy's face with cool fingers. "You were doing so well. Why did you have to make this hard?"

"Help," Dorothy managed. The pain was lessening but not stopping, waves of it that crested and receded but never fully disappeared. "Hurts—"

"Of course it hurts. You're fighting yourself." Crystal's thumb stroked Dorothy's cheek, almost tender. "Your body wants to transform. Your mind is the only thing resisting. But minds can be taught, Dorothy. Minds can learn."

She produced something from her pocket—a small device, sleek and white, with a single button. Pressed it. The wristband's pain stopped instantly, replaced by something worse: nothing. Complete absence of sensation in her left arm. Numbness that spread like frost.

"The wristband has multiple functions," Crystal said conversationally. "Pain for resistance. Pleasure for compliance. And this—complete neural override. Right now, you can't feel your arm. In sixty seconds, you won't be able to move it. In two minutes, the paralysis spreads to your whole left side." She paused. "Unless you submit."

"Fuck you." Dorothy's voice was shaking. Her arm hung useless at her side, and she could feel the numbness creeping up her shoulder, into her neck. "I signed a contract. You can't—"

"You signed a contract that included mandatory participation in the wellness program. You're participating. This is part of the program." Crystal's smile was patient. "You're not the first resident to reach this point. The smart ones always struggle the hardest. But you all learn eventually."

The numbness was in her chest now. Dorothy's breathing was getting shallow, panicked. She tried to move her left leg and couldn't. Tried to scream and managed only a whisper.

"Submit," Crystal said. "Say the words, and I'll stop it. Say you want to transform. Say you want to be happy. Say you want to let go."

"No—"

"Two minutes are almost up. After that, the paralysis becomes permanent. You'll spend the rest of your life unable to move, unable to speak, just a consciousness trapped in a body that won't obey. Is that what you want? To be aware but helpless forever?"

Dorothy's vision was graying at the edges. She couldn't feel half her body. Couldn't breathe properly. And beneath the terror, her analytical mind was still working—barely, sluggishly—calculating odds and outcomes.

She would die here. Or wish she was dead. Crystal wasn't bluffing; Dorothy could see it in her eyes, that complete absence of doubt or mercy. Elysian Heights had done this before, would do it again, and no one would stop them because no one knew she was in danger.

The settlement had been a trap. The contract had been a trap. Her intelligence had been her undoing, making her think she could outmaneuver something that had been designed by people smarter and more ruthless than she'd imagined possible.

"Submit," Crystal said again. "Or die. Your choice, Dorothy. Your last choice."

The numbness was in her jaw. Dorothy couldn't feel her tongue. Couldn't form words properly. But she could still think—just barely, just enough to understand what submission meant.

It meant letting them win. Letting them erase who she was. Becoming another Tiffany, another platinum blonde mannequin who'd forgotten she'd ever been human.

But being a mannequin meant being alive. Meant surviving. And some animal part of her brain, the part that existed below language and identity, chose survival.

"I—" Her voice was barely audible. "I submit."

The numbness stopped spreading. Held steady. Crystal watched her, evaluating.

"Say it properly. Say you want to transform."

"I want to transform."

"Say you want to be happy."

"I want to be happy." Dorothy was crying now, tears hot on her cheeks, the only warmth in her freezing body.

"Say you want to let go."

"I want—" Her voice broke. This was the line. The last line. Once she said it, meant it, there would be nothing left to hold onto. "I want to let go."

Crystal pressed the button again. Sensation flooded back into Dorothy's body—not gradually but all at once, overwhelming and terrible. She gasped, sobbed, curled into herself on the cold bathroom floor.

"Good girl," Crystal said. "See? That wasn't so hard. You just had to stop fighting."

She helped Dorothy to her feet, steady and strong, and Dorothy let her. Had no strength left to resist. Her phone lay on the floor, screen cracked. Crystal picked it up, read the unsent message, and smiled.

"You won't need this anymore." She dropped the phone into her pocket. "We'll get you a new one. A simpler one. You don't need to contact lawyers or paralegals or anyone from your old life. You just need to focus on your transformation."

Dorothy nodded. Had no will left to do anything else.

"Now, let's get you to yoga. You've missed the first fifteen minutes, but that's okay. We'll have you do an extra session this evening to make up for it. And a special smoothie—the accelerated formula. You've proven you need more intensive intervention."

"Yes, Crystal."

The words came out automatically. Dorothy heard them, recognized them as surrender, and felt something inside her crack completely. Not her will—that had broken when she'd submitted. This was deeper. Her sense of self. The narrative she'd been telling herself about who Dorothy Quinn was and what Dorothy Quinn valued.

That narrative had been a story. Just a story. And stories could be rewritten.

They walked to the East Garden together, Crystal's hand on Dorothy's lower back, guiding her. The other residents were in tree pose, balanced and serene, and when Dorothy joined them at the back of the class, they smiled at her. Welcoming. Knowing.

She'd crossed a threshold. They could see it on her face.

Tiffany waved from the front row, her expression bright with approval. Dorothy waved back, and her hand moved with a looseness she'd never had before. Graceful. Feminine. Empty of intention.

The subliminal audio played its patient litany. The morning sun warmed her skin. And as Dorothy moved through the poses—warrior, dancer, goddess—she felt her consciousness beginning to fragment.

Not breaking. Reforming. The pieces of Dorothy Quinn that had been compressed by terror and pain and the animal need to survive were rearranging themselves into a new configuration. One that didn't hurt. One that didn't fight.

One that smiled when Crystal said, "Beautiful work, Dorothy. You're transforming so well."

Because she was transforming. Could feel it happening in real time, her neurons rewiring, her sense of identity loosening its grip. The woman who'd walked into Elysian Heights six weeks ago was dissolving. And in her place, something softer was emerging.

Something that wanted to be pretty more than smart. That wanted to be desired more than respected. That found thinking exhausting and surrender ecstatic.

Dorothy Quinn was dying.

But the woman she was becoming didn't mourn her.

The woman she was becoming was too busy smiling.

—

That evening, after the accelerated smoothie and the extra yoga session and the special meditation where Crystal's voice guided her deeper into trance than she'd ever gone before, Dorothy sat in her room and tried to remember what she'd been fighting for.

The reasons wouldn't come. Just vague concepts—career, intelligence, autonomy—that felt abstract and unimportant. What mattered was how she felt right now: calm, soft, pretty. Her reflection smiled at her from the mirror, and she smiled back, and neither of them questioned whether the smile was real.

The wristband pulsed green. Approval. She'd gone the entire evening without a single warning.

She was learning. Finally learning. What it meant to be good.

And good felt better than smart ever had.

### The Pretty Prison

# CHAPTER SIX

The woman who woke up on day sixty wore Dorothy Quinn's face but had forgotten her name.

Not forgotten, exactly. The information existed somewhere in her brain, filed under *Previous Identity* along with other facts that felt historical rather than personal. She'd been a lawyer. She'd been serious. She'd worn dark colors and thought thoughts that went in complicated directions.

But that woman felt like someone she'd read about. A character in a story that had ended badly.

The woman in the mirror—*this* woman—was so much better.

She stood naked in the bathroom, examining herself with the attention to detail that had once been reserved for contract review. Platinum blonde hair that fell to her waist in perfect waves, maintained by weekly salon appointments she didn't remember scheduling. Skin bronzed and flawless, not a pore visible, not a blemish permitted. Her body was a sculpture: breasts that defied physics, waist impossibly narrow, hips that curved exactly right. When she moved, everything moved correctly. Gracefully. Like she'd been designed rather than born.

"I'm so pretty," she said out loud, and giggled at the sound of her own voice.

It was true, though. She was pretty. Being pretty was the most important thing about her. The only thing that really mattered.

The wristband pulsed green—it was always green now—and text scrolled across its face: *GOOD MORNING, DOTTIE. TODAY IS YOUR COMPLETION DAY. PLEASE DRESS IN YOUR CEREMONY OUTFIT AND PROCEED TO THE REFLECTION GARDEN.*

Dottie. That was her name now. Crystal had given it to her last week, said it suited her better than Dorothy, which was too serious and stuffy for someone so sweet and soft. Dottie had cried with happiness when she'd heard it. Cried and hugged Crystal and felt so grateful that someone had finally seen who she really was underneath all that trying to be smart.

The ceremony outfit hung in her closet, still wrapped in tissue paper: a pink dress that looked like it cost more than—well, more than something expensive. She couldn't quite hold onto the comparison. Numbers got slippery lately. But the dress was beautiful, and beautiful was what mattered.

She slipped it on, watching herself in the mirror. The fabric clung to every curve, the neckline plunged in a way that made her breasts impossible to ignore, the hem ended high enough to show off legs that seemed to go on forever. She looked like a doll. A perfect, plastic, pretty doll.

The thought made her wet.

Dottie pressed her thighs together, felt the heat between them, and giggled again. Everything made her giggle now. Everything made her happy. She was so lucky to be here, so lucky to have transformed, so lucky to have let go of all that thinking that had made her miserable.

She applied makeup with the muscle memory that had replaced her legal knowledge. Pink lips, glossy and full. Eyes lined and shadowed to look bigger, more innocent. Blush on her cheeks and the apples of her breasts. She looked like sex. Like availability. Like a fantasy made flesh.

"I'm Dottie," she told her reflection. "I'm twenty-eight years old, and I'm the newest spokesmodel for Elysian Heights Wellness Community. I help women discover their true feminine potential through transformation and surrender."

The words came out smooth and rehearsed, like a pageant answer. She'd practiced them for days under Crystal's guidance, and now they felt more true than anything she used to believe about herself.

The old Dorothy had thought truth was something you found through analysis. But Dottie knew better. Truth was something you felt. And she felt pretty and empty and so, so happy.

—

The Reflection Garden had been transformed into a ceremony space. White chairs arranged in rows, filled with residents at every stage of transformation. The newer ones still had darkness in their eyes, still fought sometimes, still remembered who they'd been. The middle ones were softening, lightening, learning to smile without thinking about it. And at the front, the completed ones—Tiffany and Madison and Crystal-Anne and all the other platinum perfections who'd graduated before her—glowed like angels in their pink dresses.

They were her sisters now. Her real family. Not like the parents who'd pushed her toward law school, who'd valued her brain over her beauty. These women understood what mattered.

Crystal stood at the center, radiant in white, her smile proud and possessive. "Welcome, beautiful souls, to Dottie's Completion Ceremony. Sixty days ago, Dorothy Quinn arrived at Elysian Heights—angry, stressed, trapped in a prison of her own intelligence. Today, she leaves that prison behind forever."

Applause. Dottie walked down the aisle, her heels clicking on stone, her hips swaying exactly right. She'd practiced this walk. Had learned to move like water, like honey, like something men wanted to consume. Every eye was on her, and the attention felt better than anything her brain had ever produced.

She took her place beside Crystal, and Crystal's hand found hers, squeezed it with maternal affection.

"Tell us, Dottie. How do you feel?"

The microphone Crystal handed her felt tiny in her grip. Dottie looked out at the audience—at the residents who would follow her path, at the completed ones who'd paved it—and felt her smile widen until her face hurt.

"I feel amazing! Like, I spent so many years trying to be smart and successful, and I was just so stressed and unhappy all the time. I thought being a lawyer meant something, but it didn't. It just meant I was lonely and tired and like, really judgmental of people who seemed happy." She paused, the way Crystal had taught her, letting the words sink in. "But now I'm free. I don't have to think anymore. I just get to be pretty and soft and helpful. And that feels so good."

More applause. Someone in the back row—a new arrival, her hair still dark—looked horrified. Dottie wanted to go hug her, tell her it was okay, that the fear would pass and the pleasure would come and everything would be so much better once she stopped fighting.

Crystal gestured to the screen behind them, and Dottie's transformation timeline appeared in photographs. Day one: sharp suit, severe expression, intelligence radiating from her eyes like a warning. Day fifteen: yoga outfit, lighter hair, smile starting to soften. Day thirty: blonde, beautiful, the thinking starting to drain from her face. Day forty-five: platinum highlights, curves in all the right places, giggling at something off-camera.

And today: complete. Perfect. Empty of everything but the desire to be desired.

"The woman in that first photograph doesn't exist anymore," Crystal said. "She's been freed from the burden of her own mind. And in her place, we have Dottie—happy, feminine, exactly who she was meant to be."

Dottie nodded, felt tears prick her eyes. Happy tears. Grateful tears. She was so lucky that Elysian Heights had saved her from herself.

"As our newest spokesmodel, Dottie will help us reach more women who need transformation. She'll appear in our promotional materials, speak at wellness conferences, show the world what's possible when you stop trying to be something exhausting and start becoming something beautiful."

The contract Crystal produced was simple—so much simpler than the one Dorothy had signed sixty days ago. Just a few pages, large print, words that didn't hurt to read. Employment agreement. Spokesmodel duties. Compensation in room and board and maintenance and the continued supply of her daily smoothies.

Dottie signed without reading it. Reading was hard now, and hard things weren't necessary. Crystal would take care of everything. Crystal always knew what was best.

"Welcome to your new life," Crystal said, and kissed her forehead like a blessing.

The residents stood, applauding, and Dottie felt their approval wash over her like sunshine. This was what she'd been missing all those years in Chicago—community, acceptance, purpose. Not the hollow purpose of winning cases or making partner, but real purpose: being beautiful for other people. Making them happy by being pretty. Helping other women see that they could transform too.

Tiffany rushed forward, wrapped her in a hug that smelled like vanilla and chemicals and sisterhood. "You did it! I'm so proud of you! You're going to be such a good spokesmodel!"

"Thank you!" Dottie hugged her back, felt their identical bodies press together, two versions of the same perfection. "I couldn't have done it without you showing me how good it feels to let go!"

They pulled apart, and Dottie caught sight of herself in one of the garden's reflective panels. Saw a woman who looked nothing like the lawyer who'd arrived. Saw someone who'd been stripped down to base components and rebuilt as something pleasing. Aesthetic. Consumable.

She waited for the horror. For some spark of the old Dorothy to surface, screaming that this was wrong, that she'd been destroyed, that the woman in the reflection was a victim pretending to be willing.

But the horror didn't come. Just satisfaction. Just pride in how she looked, in what she'd become.

The old Dorothy had been the prison. This—being Dottie—was freedom.

—

That night, in her room, she recorded her first promotional video.

The script was simple, written by Crystal, designed to sound spontaneous: "Hi! I'm Dottie, and I just completed my transformation journey at Elysian Heights! Sixty days ago, I was stressed, unhappy, and trapped in a career that didn't fulfill me. But the amazing wellness team here helped me discover my true feminine potential. Now I'm happier, healthier, and more confident than ever! If you're ready to let go of who you think you should be and become who you're meant to be, Elysian Heights is waiting for you!"

She recorded it twenty times, each take brighter and emptier than the last, until Crystal declared it perfect. Watching it back, Dottie barely recognized herself—not because she looked different, but because the woman on screen seemed so completely happy. So absolutely certain that she'd made the right choice.

And she had. Dottie was sure of it. Transformation was the right choice. Surrender was the right choice. Letting Crystal and the smoothies and the wristband and the subliminal audio reprogram her into something pretty was the right choice.

All the choices that had led her here had been right.

She uploaded the video to Elysian Heights' social media accounts, watched the likes and comments start rolling in. Women asking how to enroll. Women saying they wanted what she had. Women who looked at her platinum perfection and saw not a warning but an aspiration.

Dottie smiled at the screen, at all those potential futures, at all the women who would follow her path from complex to simple, from thinking to feeling, from human to doll.

"You're going to love it here," she whispered to them. "It's so easy once you stop fighting."

The wristband pulsed green. Approval. Always approval now.

Because Dottie was good. Dottie was perfect. Dottie was exactly what Elysian Heights had designed her to be.

And somewhere, locked in a room in her mind she could no longer access, Dorothy Quinn was screaming.

But the soundproofing was excellent.

And screaming burned calories that could be better spent smiling.

—

### The Architecture of Absence

# CHAPTER SEVEN

The interviewer from *Modern Wellness* magazine had kind eyes and a digital recorder that Dottie found herself staring at because focusing on questions was getting harder.

"So, Dottie, you've become the face of Elysian Heights. How does that feel?"

They sat in the Serenity Lounge—all white furniture and pink accents and the ever-present scent of jasmine that Dottie no longer noticed. Through the windows, new arrivals moved through their first yoga session, still dark-haired, still thinking, still fighting. Dottie remembered being like that. Sort of. The memory was fuzzy, like something that had happened to someone else.

"It feels amazing!" Her voice had that breathy quality now, automatic and permanent. "Like, I get to help so many women discover what I discovered. That being pretty and happy is so much better than being stressed and smart."

The interviewer's pen moved across her notepad. She was in her forties, professional blazer, wedding ring, the kind of competence that Dottie had once possessed but could no longer quite conceptualize. "You were a corporate lawyer before coming here. Do you miss that work?"

Dottie tilted her head, an expression she'd practiced in the mirror because Crystal said it made her look cute and confused. "Miss it? No, not at all. That person was so unhappy. She worked all the time and didn't have any fun or like, appreciate her body or know how to just *be*, you know?"

"But you graduated summa cum laude. Built a successful practice. That must have required significant intelligence."

The words were English, but they didn't quite connect. Dottie smiled wider—smiling helped when she didn't understand things. "I guess? But intelligence just made me tired. Now I don't have to think about complicated stuff. I just have to be pretty and help promote the community and make sure I'm taking care of my body. It's so much simpler."

The interviewer studied her with an expression Dottie couldn't quite read. Something between pity and fascination. "Some critics have suggested that Elysian Heights engages in coercive practices. That residents don't truly consent to their transformations."

"Oh my god, that's so not true!" Dottie leaned forward, earnest, her breasts straining against the pink dress that had become her uniform. "Like, I signed a contract. I chose to come here. Everything that happened was because I wanted to be happier and prettier and less stressed. Nobody forced me."

The wristband pulsed green under her sleeve. Approval. The words had been correct—the ones Crystal had made her practice for media interviews. Deny coercion. Emphasize choice. Make transformation look like empowerment.

"And you're happy now?"

"So happy! The happiest I've ever been!" It came out automatic, cheerful, and Dottie couldn't tell if it was true or just something her mouth knew how to say. The distinction didn't seem important. "I get to help other women, and I look amazing, and I don't have all those anxious thoughts anymore. It's like, perfect."

—

After the interview, Dottie had her daily appointment with Dr. Reeves, the neuroscientist who monitored her "cognitive optimization."

The lab was in the basement level—too clinical for the aesthetic spaces upstairs, all white tile and equipment that hummed and blinked. Dr. Reeves was in her fifties, severe in the way successful women often were, and she studied Dottie with the detachment of someone examining a successful experiment.

"Sit, please. We'll do the standard assessment."

Dottie sat, crossed her legs the way Crystal had taught her—ankle over knee, not knee over knee, because it made her legs look longer. The doctor pulled up her file on a tablet, and Dottie caught a glimpse of the name at the top: *Quinn, Dorothy - Subject 47.*

"Count backward from one hundred by sevens."

"Um... one hundred... ninety-three..." Dottie paused, her forehead creasing with effort. Numbers were hard now. Like trying to grab water. "Eighty... six?"

"Close enough. Name as many words as you can that start with the letter F."

"F... um... fun! And... fashion! And... face? And..." Her mind felt blank, smooth, like a whiteboard that had been wiped clean. "I can't think of any more."

Dr. Reeves made a note. "What was your undergraduate degree in?"

"I... don't remember. Something boring probably." Dottie giggled because not remembering felt funny rather than frightening. "Does it matter? I'm not using it."

"Your law school?"

"Um... somewhere in Chicago?" The information was there somewhere, locked behind doors she couldn't open. "I'm sorry, I'm not very good at remembering stuff anymore."

"You're not meant to be." Dr. Reeves pulled up a brain scan—Dottie's brain scan, though she didn't recognize it as belonging to her. Areas lit up in different colors, some bright, some dim, some completely dark. "Hippocampal volume reduced by thirty-two percent. Prefrontal cortex activity suppressed to baseline. Enhanced activation in the nucleus accumbens and ventral striatum—pleasure centers. You're operating primarily on reward-seeking behavior now, with minimal executive function."

Dottie nodded like she understood, but the words were just sounds. Science sounds. Doctor sounds. Not sounds that connected to anything meaningful.

"You've become an ideal case study. Complete personality dissolution with maintained physical health and apparent subjective wellbeing." Dr. Reeves stood, circled Dottie like a sculptor admiring her work. "How do you feel about what's been done to you?"

"I feel grateful!" The answer was immediate, genuine. "Like, I was so miserable before, and now I'm pretty and happy and helpful. That's good, right?"

"That depends on one's definition of 'good.'" The doctor's expression remained neutral. "But you're no longer capable of philosophical inquiry, so the question is moot. You may go. Maintain your smoothie regimen. We'll schedule another scan in six months to track continued degradation."

Degradation. The word should have frightened her. Should have triggered some survival instinct, some desperate grab for the self that was dissolving. But Dottie just smiled and thanked the doctor and walked back upstairs in her heels that clicked precisely with each step.

—

That evening, the community gathered for a celebration. Another completion ceremony—a woman named Sarah who'd been a software engineer and was now Sunshine, giggling and platinum and empty. Dottie watched from the front row, applauding at the right moments, smiling at Sunshine's transformation video.

She'd done that. Had stood where Sunshine was standing. Had said similar words about freedom and happiness and letting go. But the memory felt distant, like a movie she'd watched rather than experienced.

Tiffany sat beside her, their identical bodies pressed together in the crowded seating. "Isn't she beautiful? I remember when she first arrived—so serious, so tense. Look at her now!"

Dottie looked. Saw a woman who'd been disassembled and reconstructed. Saw the future that awaited every resident who stayed long enough. Saw herself reflected in Sunshine's vacant eyes.

"So beautiful," she agreed.

After the ceremony, a group of donors arrived—men in expensive suits, the kind who funded Elysian Heights' expansion, who paid to watch transformations happen, who wanted proof their investments were yielding returns. Crystal introduced Dottie as the flagship success story.

"This is remarkable work," one man said, circling her with the same clinical assessment Dr. Reeves had performed. "She seems genuinely happy."

"Oh, I am!" Dottie performed her enthusiasm like a trained seal. "Being here has changed my life! I used to be so stressed about my career and trying to be smart, and now I just focus on being pretty and helpful and making people happy!"

The man's smile made her skin crawl—or should have made her skin crawl, but the sensation translated differently now. Just awareness that he was looking at her body, assessing its value, and that his assessment determined her worth. She shifted her stance, pushed her chest forward slightly, gave him what he wanted to see.

"And you have no desire to return to your previous profession?"

"Profession?" Dottie blinked, genuinely confused. "I don't... I can't really remember what I did before. Something with papers? But this is so much better. I get to help promote the community and show other women how good transformation feels."

"Extraordinary," the man murmured. "The cognitive restructuring is even more complete than the promotional materials suggested."

Crystal's hand settled on Dottie's shoulder, warm and possessive. "Dottie represents our vision fully realized. Total feminine optimization. She's happy, compliant, and serves as living proof that our methods work."

They discussed her like she wasn't there—technical terms, success metrics, the scalability of the transformation protocol. Dottie stood still and pretty, her smile fixed, her mind drifting to the new pink heels she'd seen in the boutique, to whether she'd have time for a facial before tomorrow's photo shoot, to how good the evening smoothie was going to taste.

She'd become exactly what they'd designed her to be: beautiful, empty, and content in her emptiness.

The woman she'd been—Dorothy Quinn, attorney, fighter, the one who'd thought she could expose Elysian Heights—was gone. Not suppressed. Not hidden. Gone. Dissolved into pink smoothies and subliminal audio and the patient reconstruction of her neural pathways until nothing remained but this: Dottie, who giggled and posed and felt happy because her brain no longer possessed the architecture for anything else.

And in her perfectly optimized consciousness, she felt no loss. Just the warm contentment of a creature who'd finally stopped struggling against its cage.

Because the cage had become her body, and her body had become her identity, and her identity was now indistinguishable from the pink dress and platinum hair and empty smile.

She was free.

Or she was imprisoned so completely she'd forgotten what freedom looked like.

The distinction, in the end, was academic.

And Dottie no longer understood academics.

She only understood pretty.

And pretty, everyone assured her, was enough.
